It is proved from the oldest records, that perfumes have\nbeen in use from the earliest periods. The origin of this, like that of\nmany other arts, is lost in the depth of its antiquity; though it had\nits rise, no doubt, in religious observances. Among the nations of\nantiquity, an offering of perfumes was regarded as a token of the most\nprofound respect and homage. Incense, or Frankincense, which exudes by\nincision and <a></a>dries as a gum, from <i>Arbor-thurifera</i>, was formerly burnt\nin the temples of all religions, in honor of the divinities that were\nthere adored. Many of the primitive Christians were put to death because\nthey would not offer incense to idols.</p><div class=\"blockquot\"><p>\"Of the use of these luxuries by the Greeks, and afterwards by the\nRomans, Pliny and Seneca gives much information respecting perfume\ndrugs, the method of collecting them, and the prices at which they\nsold. Oils and powder perfumery were most lavishly used, for even\nthree times a day did some of the luxurious people anoint and\nscent themselves, carrying their precious perfumes with them to\nthe baths in costly and elegant boxes called <span class=\"smcap\">Narthecia</span>.\"</p></div><p>In the Romish Church incense is used in many ceremonies, and\nparticularly at the solemn funerals of the hierarchy, and other\npersonages of exalted rank.</p><p>Pliny makes a note of the tree from which frankincense is procured, and\ncertain passages in his works indicate that dried flowers were used in\nhis time by way of perfume, and that they were, as now, mixed with\nspices, a compound which the modern perfumer calls <i>pot-pourri</i>, used\nfor scenting apartments, and generally placed in some ornamental Vase.</p><p>It was not uncommon among the Egyptian ladies to carry about the person\na little pouch of odoriferous gums, as is the case to the present day\namong the Chinese, and to wear beads made of scented wood. The\n\"bdellium\" mentioned by Moses in Genesis is a perfuming gum, resembling\nfrankincense, if not identical with it.</p><p>Several passages in Exodus prove the use of perfumes <a></a>at a very early\nperiod among the Hebrews. In the thirtieth chapter of Exodus the Lord\nsaid unto Moses: \"1. And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon;\nof Shittim wood shalt thou make it.\" \"7. And Aaron shall burn thereon\nsweet incense every morning; when he dresseth the lamps he shall burn\nincense upon it.\" \"34. Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha,\nand galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall\nthere be a like weight.\" \"35. And thou shalt make it a perfume, a\nconfection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together pure and\nholy.\" \"36. And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it\nbefore the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will\nmeet with thee; it shall be unto you most holy.\" \"37. And as for the\nperfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according\nto the composition thereof; it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord.\"\n\"38. Whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto, shall even be\ncut off from his people.\"</p><div class=\"blockquot\"><p>\"It was from this religious custom, of employing incense in the\nancient temples, that the royal prophet drew that beautiful simile\nof his, when he petitioned that his prayers might ascend before\nthe Lord like incense, Luke 1:10. It was while all the multitude\nwas praying without, at the hour of incense, that there appeared\nto Zachary an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the\naltar of incense. That the nations attached a meaning not only of\npersonal reverence, but also of religious homage, to an offering\nof incense, is demonstrable from the instance of the Magi, who,\nhaving fallen down to adore the new-born Jesus, and recognized his\nDivinity, presented Him with gold, myrrh <a></a>and frankincense. The\nprimitive Christians imitated the example of the Jews, and adopted\nthe use of incense at the celebration of the Liturgy. St. Ephræm,\na father of the Syriac Church, directed in his will that no\naromatic perfumes should be bestowed upon him at his funeral, but\nthat the spices should rather be given to the sanctuary. The use\nof incense in all the Oriental churches is perpetual, and almost\ndaily; nor do any of them ever celebrate their Liturgy without it,\nunless compelled by necessity. The Coptic, as well as other\nEastern Christians, observe the same ceremonial as the Latin\nChurch in incensing their altar, the sacred vessels, and\necclesiastical personages.\"—<span class=\"smcap\">Dr. Rock's</span> <i>Hierurgia</i>.</p></div><p>Perfumes were used in the Church service, not only under the form of\nincense, but also mixed in the oil and wax for the lamps and lights\ncommanded to be burned in the house of the Lord. The brilliancy and\nfragrance which were often shed around a martyr's sepulchre, at the\ncelebration of his festival, by multitudes of lamps and tapers, fed with\naromatics, have been noticed by St. Paulinus:—</p><div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\">\"With crowded lamps are these bright altars crowned,<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">And waxen tapers, shedding perfume round<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">From fragrant wicks, beam calm a scented ray,<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">To gladden night, and joy e'en radiant day.\"<br></span>\n</div><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\"><span class=\"smcap\">Dr. Rock's</span> <i>Hierurgia</i>.<br></span>\n</div></div><p>Constantine the Great provided fragrant oils, to be burned at the altars\nof the greater churches in Rome; and St. Paulinus, of Nola, a writer of\nthe end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century, tells us how,\nin his times, wax tapers were made for church use, so as to shed\nfragrance as they burned:—</p><div class=\"blockquot\"><p>\"Lumina cerates adolentur odora papyris.\"</p></div><p><a></a>A perfume in common use, even to this day, was the invention of one of\nthe earliest of the Roman nobles, named Frangipani, and still bears his\nname; it is a powder, or sachet, composed of every known spice, in equal\nproportions, to which is added ground iris or orris root, in weight\nequal to the whole, with one per cent. of musk or civet. A liquid of the\nsame name, invented by his grandson Mercutio Frangipani, is also in\ncommon use, prepared by digesting the Frangipane powder in rectified\nspirits, which dissolves out the fragrant principles. This has the merit\nof being the most lasting perfume made.</p><div class=\"blockquot\"><p>\"The trade for the East in perfume-drugs caused many a vessel to\nspread its sails to the Red Sea, and many a camel to plod over\nthat tract which gave to Greece and Syria their importance as\nmarkets, and vitality to the rocky city of Petra. Southern Italy\nwas not long ere it occupied itself in ministering to the luxury\nof the wealthy, by manufacturing scented unguents and perfumes. So\nnumerous were the <span class=\"smcap\">Unguentarii</span>, or perfumers, that they\nare said to have filled the great street of ancient\nCapua.\"—<span class=\"smcap\">Hofmann</span>.</p></div><p>As an art, in England, perfumery has attained little or no distinction.\nThis has arisen from those who follow it as a trade, maintaining a\nmysterious secrecy about their processes. No manufacture can ever become\ngreat or important to the community that is carried on under a veil of\nmystery.</p><div class=\"blockquot\"><p>\"On the subject of trade mystery I will only observe, that I am\nconvinced that it would be far more to the interest of\nmanufacturers if they were more willing to profit by the\nexperience of others, and less fearful and jealous of the supposed\nsecrets of their craft. It is a great mistake to think that a\nsuccessful <a></a>manufacturer is one who has carefully preserved the\nsecrets of his trade, or that peculiar modes of effecting simple\nthings, processes unknown in other factories, and mysteries beyond\nthe comprehension of the vulgar, are in any way essential to skill\nas a manufacturer, or to success as a trader.\"—<span class=\"smcap\">Professor\nSolly</span>.</p></div><p>If the horticulturists of England were instructed how to collect the\nodors of flowers, a new branch of manufacture would spring up to vie\nwith our neighbors' skill in it across the Channel.</p><p>Of our five senses, that of <span class=\"smcap\">Smelling</span> has been treated with\ncomparative indifference. However, as knowledge progresses, the various\nfaculties with which the Creator has thought proper in his wisdom to\nendow man will become developed, and the faculty of Smelling will meet\nwith its share of tuition as well as Sight, Hearing, Touch, and Taste.</p><p>Flowers yield perfumes in all climates, but those growing in the warmer\nlatitudes are most prolific in their odor, while those from the colder\nare the sweetest. Hooker, in his travels in Iceland, speaks of the\ndelightful fragrance of the flowers in the valley of Skardsheidi; we\nknow that winter-green, violets, and primroses are found here, and the\nwild thyme, in great abundance. Mr. Louis Piesse, in company with\nCaptain Sturt, exploring the wild regions of South Australia, writes:\n\"The rains have clothed the earth with a green as beautiful as a\nShropshire meadow in May, and with flowers, too, as sweet as an English\nviolet; the pure white anemone resembles it in scent. The Yellow Wattle,\n<a></a>when in flower, is splendid, and emits a most fragrant odor.\"</p><p>Though many of the finest perfumes come from the East Indies, Ceylon,\nMexico, and Peru, the South of Europe is the only real garden of utility\nto the perfumer. Grasse and Nice are the principal seats of the art;\nfrom their geographical position, the grower, within comparatively short\ndistances, has at command that change of climate best fitted to bring to\nperfection the plants required for his trade. On the seacoast his Cassiæ\ngrows without fear of frost, one night of which would destroy all the\nplants for a season; while, nearer the Alps, his violets are found\nsweeter than if grown in the warmer situations, where the orange tree\nand mignionette bloom to perfection. England can claim the superiority\nin the growth of lavender and peppermint; the essential oils extracted\nfrom these plants grown at Mitcham, in Surrey, realize eight times the\nprice in the market of those produced in France or elsewhere, and are\nfully worth the difference for delicacy of odor.</p><p>The odors of plants reside in different parts of them, sometimes in the\nroots, as in the iris and vitivert; the stem or wood, in cedar and\nsandal; the leaves, in mint, patchouly, and thyme; the flower, in the\nroses and violets; the seeds in the Tonquin bean and caraway; the bark,\nin cinnamon, &amp;c.</p><p>Some plants yield more than one odor, which are quite distinct and\ncharacteristic. The orange tree, for instance, gives three—from the\nleaves one called<a></a> <i>petit grain</i>; from the flowers we procure <i>neroli</i>;\nand from the rind of the fruit, essential oil of orange, <i>essence of\nPortugal</i>. On this account, perhaps, this tree is the most valuable of\nall to the operative perfumer.</p><p>The fragrance or odor of plants is owing, in nearly all cases, to a\nperfectly volatile oil, either contained in small vessels, or sacs\nwithin them, or generated from time to time, during their life, as when\nin blossom. Some few exude, by incision, odoriferous gums, as benzoin,\nolibanum, myrrh, &amp;c.; others give, by the same act, what are called\nbalsams, which appear to be mixtures of an odorous oil and an inodorous\ngum. Some of these balsams are procured in the country to which the\nplant is indigenous by boiling it in water for a time, straining, and\nthen boiling again, or evaporating it down till it assumes the\nconsistency of treacle. In this latter way is balsam of Peru procured\nfrom the <i>Myroxylon peruiferum</i>, and the balsam of Tolu from the\n<i>Myroxylon toluiferum</i>. Though their odors are agreeable, they are not\nmuch applied in perfumery for handkerchief use, but by some they are\nmixed with soap, and in England they are valued more for their medicinal\nproperties than for their fragrance.</p><hr style=\"width: 65%;\">"
