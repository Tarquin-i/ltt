It\nis of matter pertaining to the faculty of Smelling that this book mainly\ntreats. Of the five senses, that of smelling is the least valued, and,\nas a consequence, is the least tutored; but we must not conclude from\nthis, our own act, that it is of insignificant importance to our welfare\nand happiness.</p><p>By neglecting to tutor the olfactory nerve, we are constantly led to\nbreathe impure air, and thus poison the body by neglecting the warning\ngiven at the gate of the lungs. Persons who use perfumes are more\nsensitive to the presence of a vitiated atmosphere than those who\nconsider the faculty of smelling as an almost useless gift.</p><p>In the early ages of the world the use of perfumes was in constant\npractice, and it had the high sanction of Scriptural authority.</p><p>The patrons of perfumery have always been considered <a></a>the most civilized\nand refined people of the earth. If refinement consists in knowing how\nto enjoy the faculties which we possess, then must we learn not only how\nto distinguish the harmony of color and form, in order to please the\nsight, the melody of sweet sounds to delight the ear; the comfort of\nappropriate fabrics to cover the body, and to please the touch, but the\nsmelling faculty must be shown how to gratify itself with the\nodoriferous products of the garden and the forest.</p><p>Pathologically considered, the use of perfumes is in the highest degree\nprophylactic; the refreshing qualities of the citrine odors to an\ninvalid is well known. Health has often been restored when life and\ndeath trembled in the balance, by the mere sprinkling of essence of\ncedrat in a sick chamber.</p><p>The commercial value of flowers is of no mean importance to the wealth\nof nations. But, vast as is the consumption of perfumes by the people\nunder the rule of the British Empire, little has been done in England\ntowards the establishment of flower-farms, or the production of the raw\nodorous substances in demand by the manufacturing perfumers of Britain;\nconsequently nearly the whole are the produce of foreign countries.\nHowever, I have every hope that ere long the subject will attract the\nattention of the Society of Arts, and favorable results will doubtless\nfollow. Much of the waste land in England, and especially in Ireland,\ncould <a></a>be very profitably employed if cultivated with odor-bearing\nplants.</p><p>The climate of some of the British colonies especially fits them for the\nproduction of odors from flowers that require elevated temperature to\nbring them to perfection.</p><p>But for the lamented death of Mr. Charles Piesse,<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_A_1\">[A]</a> Colonial Secretary\nfor Western Australia, I have every reason to believe that flower-farms\nwould have been established in that colony long ere the publication of\nthis work. Though thus personally frustrated in adapting a new and\nuseful description of labor to British enterprise, I am no less sanguine\nof the final result in other hands.</p><p>Mr. Kemble, of Jamaica, has recently sent to England some fine samples\nof Oil of Behn. The Moringa, from which it is produced, has been\nsuccessfully cultivated by him. The Oil of Behn, being a perfectly\ninodorous fat oil, is a valuable agent for extracting the odors of\nflowers by the maceration process.</p><p>At no distant period I hope to see, either at the Crystal Palace,\nSydenham, at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, or elsewhere, a place to\nillustrate the commercial use of flowers—eye-lectures on the methods of\nobtaining the odors of plants and their various uses.<a></a> The\nhorticulturists of England, being generally unacquainted with the\nmethods of economizing the scents from the flowers they cultivate,\nentirely lose what would be a very profitable source of income. For many\nages copper ore was thrown over the cliffs into the sea by the Cornish\nminers working the tin streams; how much wealth was thus cast away by\nignorance we know not, but there is a perfect parallel between the old\nminers and the modern gardeners.</p><p>Many readers of the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" and of the \"Annals of\nPharmacy and Chemistry\" will recognize in the following pages much\nmatter that has already passed under their eyes.</p><p>To be of the service intended, such matter must however have a book\nform; I have therefore collected from the above-mentioned periodicals\nall that I considered might be useful to the reader.</p><p>To Sir Wm. Hooker, Dr. Lindley, Mr. W. Dickinson, and Mr. W. Bastick, I\nrespectfully tender my thanks for the assistance they have so freely\ngiven whenever I have had occasion to seek their advice.</p><hr style=\"width: 65%;\">"
