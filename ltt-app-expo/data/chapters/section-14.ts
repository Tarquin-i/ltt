They are principally\ncomposed of various starches, prepared from wheat, potatoes, and various\nnuts, mixed more or less with powdered talc—of Haüy, steatite\n(soap-stone), French chalk, oxide of bismuth, and oxide of zinc, &amp;c.

Place the bottle in a quiet\nsituation for a week; any precipitate of impurities from the carmine\nwill subside; the supernatant \"Bloom of Roses\" is then to be bottled for\nsale. If the carmine was perfectly pure there would be no precipitate;\nnearly all the carmine purchased from the makers is more or less\nsophisticated, its enormous price being a premium to its adulteration.</p><p>Carmine cannot be manufactured <i>profitably</i> on a small scale for\ncommercial purposes; four or five manufacturers supply the whole of\nEurope! M.<a></a> Titard, Rue Grenier St. Lazare, Paris, produces, without\ndoubt, the finest article; singular enough, however, the principal\noperative in the establishment is an old Englishman.</p><p>\"The preparation of the finest carmine is still a mystery, because, on\nthe one hand, its consumption being very limited, few persons are\nengaged in its manufacture, and, upon the other, the raw material being\ncostly, extensive experiments on it cannot be conveniently\nmade.\"—<span class=\"smcap\">Dr. Ure</span>.</p><p>In the <i>Encyclopédie Roret</i> will be found no less than a dozen recipes\nfor preparing carmine; the number of formulæ will convince the most\nsuperficial reader that the true form is yet withheld.</p><p>Analysis has taught us its exact composition; but a certain dexterity of\nmanipulation and proper temperature are indispensable to complete\nsuccess.</p><p>Most of the recipes given by Dr. Ure, and others, are from this source;\nbut as they possess no practical value we refrain from reprinting them.</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\">Toilet Rouges</span>.</h4><p>Are prepared of different shades by mixing fine carmine with talc\npowder, in different proportions, say, one drachm of carmine to two\nounces of talc, or one of carmine to three of talc, and so on. These\nrouges are sold in powder, and also in cake or china pots; for the\nlatter the rouge is mixed with a minute portion of solution of gum\ntragacanth. M. Titard prepares a great variety of rouges. In some\ninstances the coloring-matter of the cochineal is spread upon <a></a>thick\npaper and dried very gradually; it then assumes a beautiful green tint.\nThis curious optical effect is also observed in \"pink saucers.\" What is\nknown as Chinese book rouge is evidently made in the same way, and has\nbeen imported into this country for many years.</p><p>When the bronze green cards are moistened with a piece of damp cotton\nwool, and applied to the lips or cheeks, the color assumes a beautiful\nrosy hue. Common sorts of rouge, called \"theatre rouge,\" are made from\nthe Brazil-wood lake; another kind is derived from the safflower\n(<i>Carthamus tinctorius</i>); from this plant also is made</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\">Pink Saucers</span>.</h4><p>The safflower is washed in water until the yellow coloring-matter is\nremoved; the carthamine or color principle is then dissolved out by a\nweak solution of carbonate of soda; the coloring is then precipitated\ninto the saucers by the addition of sulphuric acid to the solution.</p><p>Cotton wool and crape being colored in the same way are used for the\nsame purpose, the former being sold as Spanish wool, the latter as\nCrépon rouge.</p><hr style=\"width: 65%;\">"
