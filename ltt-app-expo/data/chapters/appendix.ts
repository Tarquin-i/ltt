To obtain glycerine by means\nof the first of these methods is the reverse of simple, and at the same\ntime somewhat expensive; and by means of the second process, the\ndifficulty of entirely separating the saline matters of the waste liquor\nrenders it next to impossible to procure a perfectly pure result. To\nmeet both these difficulties, and to meet the steadily increasing demand\nfor glycerine, Dr. Campbell Morfit recommends the following process,\nwhich, he asserts, he has found, by experience, to combine the desirable\nadvantages of economy as regards time, trouble, and expense. One hundred\npounds of oil, tallow, lard, or stearin are to be placed in a clean\niron-bound barrel, and melted by the direct application of a current of\nsteam. Whilst still fluid and warm, add to it fifteen pounds of lime,\npreviously slaked, and made into a milky mixture with two and a half\ngallons of water; then cover the vessel, and continue the steaming for\nseveral hours, or until the saponification shall be completed. This may\nbe known when a <a></a>sample of the soap when cold gives a smooth and bright\nsurface on being scraped with the finger-nail, and at the same time,\nbreaks with a crackling noise. By this process the fat or oil is\ndecomposed, its acids uniting with the lime to form insoluble lime-soap,\nwhile the eliminated glycerine remains in solution in the water along\nwith the excess of the lime. After it has been sufficiently boiled, it\nis allowed to cool and to settle, and it is then to be strained.</p><p>The strained liquid contains only the glycerine and excess of lime, and\nrequires to be carefully concentrated by heated steam. During\nevaporation, a portion of the lime is deposited, on account of its\nlesser solubility in hot than in cold water. The residue is removed by\ntreating the evaporated liquid with a current of carbonic acid gas,\nboiling by heated steam to convert a soluble bicarbonate of lime that\nmay have been formed into insoluble neutral carbonate, decanting or\nstraining off the clear supernatant liquid from the precipitated\ncarbonate of lime, and evaporating still further, as before, if\nnecessary, so as to drive off any excess of water. As nothing fixed or\ninjurious is employed in this process, glycerine, prepared in this\nmanner, may be depended upon for its almost absolute purity.</p><p>M. Jahn's process is as follows:—</p><p>Take of finely-powdered litharge five pounds, and olive oil nine pounds.\nBoil them together over a gentle fire, constantly stirring, with the\naddition occasionally of a small quantity of warm water, until the\ncompound has the consistence of plaster. Jahn boils this plaster for\nhalf an hour with an equal weight of water, keeping it at the same time\nconstantly stirred. When cold, he pours off the supernatant fluid, and\nrepeats the boiling three times at least with a fresh portion of water.\nThe sweet fluids which result are mixed, and evaporated to six pounds,\nand sulphuretted <a></a>hydrogen conducted through them as long as sulphuret\nof lead is precipitated. The liquid filtered from the sulphuret of lead\nis to be reduced to a thin syrupy consistence by evaporation. To remove\nthe brown coloring matter, it must be treated with purified animal\ncharcoal. However, this agent does not prevent the glycerine becoming\nslightly colored upon further evaporation. It possesses also still a\nslight smell and taste of lead plaster, which may be removed by diluting\nit with water, and by digestion with animal charcoal, and some fresh\nburnt-wood charcoal. After filtration, this liquid must be evaporated\nuntil it has acquired a specific gravity of 1.21, when it will be found\nto be free from smell, and of a pale yellow color. For the preparation\nof glycerine, distilled water is necessary, to prevent it being\ncontaminated with the impurities of common water. Jahn obtained, by this\nmethod, from the above quantity of lead plaster, upwards of seven ounces\nof glycerine.—<i>Archives der Pharmacie</i>.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"TEST_FOR_ALCOHOL_IN_ESSENTIAL_OILS\"></a>TEST FOR ALCOHOL IN ESSENTIAL OILS.</h3><p>J.J. Bernoulli recommends for this purpose acetate of potash. When to an\nethereal oil, contaminated with alcohol, dry acetate of potash is added,\nthis salt dissolves in the alcohol, and forms a solution from which the\nvolatile oil separates. If the oil be free from alcohol, this salt\nremains dry therein.</p><p>Wittstein, who speaks highly of this test, has suggested the following\nmethod of applying it as the best:—In a dry test-tube, about half an\ninch in diameter, and five or six inches long, put no more than eight\ngrains of powdered <a></a>dry acetate of potash; then fill the tube two-thirds\nfull with the essential oil to be examined. The contents of the tube\nmust be well stirred with a glass rod, taking care not to allow the salt\nto rise above the oil; afterwards set aside for a short time. If the\nsalt be found at the bottom of the tube dry, it is evident that the oil\ncontains no spirit. Oftentimes, instead of the dry salt, beneath the oil\nis found a clear syrupy fluid, which is a solution of the salt in the\nspirit, with which the oil was mixed. When the oil contains only a\nlittle spirit, a small portion of the solid salt will be found under the\nsyrupy solution. Many essential oils frequently contain a trace of\nwater, which does not materially interfere with this test, because,\nalthough the acetate of potash becomes moist thereby, it still retains\nits pulverent form.</p><p>A still more certain result may be obtained by distillation in a\nwater-bath. All the essential oils which have a higher boiling-point\nthan spirit, remain in the retort, whilst the spirit passes into the\nreceiver with only a trace of the oil, where the alcohol may be\nrecognized by the smell and taste. Should, however, a doubt exist, add\nto the distillate a little acetate of potash and strong sulphuric acid,\nand heat the mixture in a test-tube to the boiling-point, when the\ncharacteristic odor of acetic ether will be manifest, if any alcohol be\npresent.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"DETECTION_OF_POPPY_AND_OTHER_DRYING_OILS_IN_ALMOND_AND_OLIVE_OILS\"></a>DETECTION OF POPPY AND OTHER DRYING OILS IN ALMOND AND OLIVE OILS.</h3><p>It is known that the olein of the drying oils may be distinguished from\nthe olein of those oils which remain greasy in the air by the first not\nbeing convertible into elaidic <a></a>acid, consequently it does not become\nsolid. Professor Wimmer has recently proposed a convenient method for\nthe formation of elaidin, which is applicable for the purpose of\ndetecting the adulteration of almond and olive oils with drying oils. He\nproduces nitrous acid by treating iron filings in a glass bottle with\nnitric acid. The vapor of nitrous acid is conducted through a glass tube\ninto water, upon which the oil to be tested is placed. If the oil of\nalmonds or olives contains only a small quantity of poppy oil when thus\ntreated, it is entirely converted into crystallized elaidin, whilst the\npoppy oil swims on the top in drops.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"COLORING_MATTER_OF_VOLATILE_OILS\"></a>COLORING MATTER OF VOLATILE OILS.</h3><h4>BY G.E. SACHSSE.</h4><p>It is well known that most ethereal oils are colorless; however, there\nare a great number colored, some of which are blue, some green, and some\nyellow. Up to the present time the question has not been decided,\nwhether it is the necessary property of ethereal oils to have a color,\nor whether their color is not due to the presence of some coloring\nmatter which can be removed. It is most probable that their color arises\nfrom the presence of a foreign substance, as the colored ethereal oils\ncan at first, by careful distillation, be obtained colorless, whilst\nlater the colored portion passes over. Subsequent appearances lead to\nthe solution of the question, and are certain evidence that ethereal\noils, when they are colored, owe their color to peculiar substances\nwhich, by certain conditions, may be communicated from one oil to\nanother. When a mixture <a></a>of oils of wormwood, lemons, and cloves is\nsubjected to distillation, the previously green-colored oil of wormwood\npasses over, at the commencement, colorless, while, towards the end of\nthe distillation, after the receiver has been frequently charged, the\noil of cloves distils over in very dense drops of a dark green color. It\ntherefore appears that the green coloring matter of the oil of wormwood\nhas been transferred to the oil of cloves.—<i>Zeitschrift für Pharmacie.</i></p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"ARTIFICIAL_PREPARATION_OF_OIL_OF_CINNAMON\"></a>ARTIFICIAL PREPARATION OF OIL OF CINNAMON.</h3><h4>BY A. STRECKER.</h4><p>Some years since, Strecker has shown that styrone, which is obtained\nwhen styracine is treated with potash, is the alcohol of cinnamic acid.\nWolff has converted this alcohol by oxidizing agents into cinnamic acid.\nThe author has now proved that under the same conditions by which\nordinary alcohol affords aldehyde, styrone affords the aldehyde of\ncinnamic acid, that is, oil of cinnamon. It is only necessary to moisten\nplatinum black with styrone, and let it remain in the air some days,\nwhen by means of the bisulphite of potash the aldehyde double compound\nmay be obtained in crystals, which should be washed in ether. By the\naddition of diluted sulphuric acid, the aldehyde of cinnamic acid is\nafterwards procured pure. These crystals also dissolve in nitric acid,\nand then form after a few moments crystals of the nitrate of the hyduret\nof cinnamyle. The conversion of styrone into the hyduret of cinnamyle by\nthe action of the platinum black is shown by the following equation:</p><div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\">C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 2 O = C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 2 HO.—<i>Comptes Rendus.</i><br></span>\n</div></div><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"DETECTION_OF_SPIKE_OIL_AND_TURPENTINE_IN_LAVENDER_OIL\"></a>DETECTION OF SPIKE OIL AND TURPENTINE IN LAVENDER OIL</h3><h4>BY DR.

The latter is generally termed oil of spike. In the\nsouth of France, whether the oil be distilled from the flowers of the\n<i>Lavandula vera</i> or <i>Lavandula spica</i>, it is named oil of lavender.</p><p>By the distillation of the whole plant or only the stalk and the leaves,\na small quantity of oil is obtained, which is rich in camphor, and is\nthere called oil of spike. Pure oil of lavender should have a specific\ngravity from .876 to .880, and be completely soluble in five parts of\nalcohol of a specific gravity of .894. A greater specific gravity shows\nthat it is mixed with oil of spike; and a less solubility, that it\ncontains oil of turpentine.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"DIFFERENT_ORANGE-FLOWER\"></a>DIFFERENT ORANGE-FLOWER WATERS FOUND IN COMMERCE</h3><h4>BY M. LEGUAY.</h4><p>There are three sorts of orange-flower waters found in commerce. The\nfirst is distilled from the flowers; the second is made with distilled\nwater and neroli; and the third is distilled from the leaves, the stems,\nand the young unripe fruit of the orange tree. The first may be easily\ndistinguished by the addition of a few drops of sulphuric <a></a>acid to some\nof the water in a tube; a fine rose color is almost immediately\nproduced. The second also gives the same color when it is freshly\nprepared; but after a certain time, two or three months at the farthest,\nthis color is no longer produced, and the aroma disappears completely.\nThe third is not discolored by the addition of the sulphuric acid; it\nhas scarcely any odor, and that rather an odor of the lemon plant than\nof orange-flowers.—<i>Bulletin de la Société Pharmaceutique d'Indre et\nLoire.</i></p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"A_FORMULA_FOR_CONCENTRATED\"></a>A FORMULA FOR CONCENTRATED ELDER-FLOWER WATER.</h3><p>Krembs recommends the following process for making a concentrated\nelder-flower water, from which he states the ordinary water can be\nextemporaneously prepared, of excellent quality, and of uniform\nstrength:—2 lbs. of the flowers are to be distilled with water until\nthat which passes into the receiver has lost nearly all perfume. This\nwill generally happen when from 15 to 18 pounds have passed over. To the\ndistillate, 2 lbs. of alcohol are to be added, and the mixture distilled\nuntil about 5 lbs. are collected. This liquor contains all the odor of\nthe flowers. To make the ordinary water, 2 ounces of the concentrated\nwater are to be added to 10 ounces of distilled water.—<i>Buchner's\nReport.</i></p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"PRACTICAL_REMARKS_ON_SPIRIT_OF_WINE\"></a>PRACTICAL REMARKS ON SPIRIT OF WINE.</h3><h4>BY THOMAS ARNALL.</h4><p>The strength of spirit of wine is, by law, regulated by proof spirit\n(sp. gr. .920) as a standard; and accordingly <a></a>as it is either stronger\nor weaker than the above, it is called so much per cent. above or below\nproof. The term <i>per cent.</i> is used in this instance in a rather\npeculiar sense. Thus, spirit of wine at 56 per cent. overproof,\nsignifies that 100 gallons of it are equal to 156 gallons of proof\nspirit; while a spirit at 20 per cent. underproof, signifies that 100\ngallons are equal to 80 gallons at proof. The rectified spirit of the\nPharmacopœia is 56 per cent. overproof, and may be reduced to proof\nby strictly adhering to the directions there given, viz., to mix five\nmeasures with three of water. The result, however, will not be eight\nmeasures of proof spirit; in consequence of the <i>contraction</i> which\nensues, there will be a deficiency of about ℥iv in each\ngallon. This must be borne in mind in preparing tinctures.</p><p>During a long series of experiments on the preparation of ethers, it\nappeared a desideratum to find a ready method of ascertaining how much\nspirit of any density would be equal to one chemical equivalent of\nabsolute alcohol. By a modification of a rule employed by the Excise,\nthis question may be easily solved. The Excise rule is as follows:—</p><p>To reduce from any given strength to any required strength, <i>add</i> the\n<i>overproof</i> per centage <i>to</i> 100, or <i>subtract</i> the <i>underproof</i> per\ncentage <i>from</i> 100. Multiply the result by the quantity of spirit, and\ndivide the product by the number obtained by <i>adding</i> the <i>required</i> per\ncentage overproof, or <i>subtracting</i> the <i>required</i> per centage\nunderproof, to or from 100, as the case may be. The result will give the\nmeasure of the spirit at the strength required.</p><p>Thus, suppose you wished to reduce 10 gallons of spirit, at 54\noverproof, down to proof, add 54 to 100 = 154; multiply by the quantity,\n10 gallons (154 × 10) = 1540. The <a></a>required strength being proof, of\ncourse there is nothing either to add to or take from 100; therefore,\n1540 divided by 100 = 15.4 gallons at proof; showing that 10 gallons\nmust be made to measure 15 gallons, 3 pints, 4 fl. oz., by the addition\nof water.</p><p>To ascertain what quantity of spirit of any given strength will contain\none equivalent of absolute alcohol. Add the overproof per centage of the\ngiven spirit to 100, as before; and with the number thus obtained divide\n4062.183. The result gives in gallons the quantity equal to four\nequivalents (46 × 4).</p><p><i>Example.</i>—How much spirit at 54 per cent. overproof is equal to 1\nequivalent of absolute alcohol?</p><p>Here,</p><p>\n54 + 100 = 154 and 4062.183 = 26.3778 galls., or 26 galls. 3 pts.<br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 9.5em;\">————</span><br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 10.5em;\">154</span><br>\n</p><p>which, divided by 4, gives 6 gallons, 4 pints, 15 oz.</p><p>Suppose the spirit to be 60 overproof,—</p><p>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 3em;\">4062.183&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {one-fourth of which is equal</span><br>\nthen ————— = 25.388 gallons, {to 6 gallons, 2 pints,<br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 2.5em;\">(100 + 60)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  {15-1/2 oz.</span><br>\n</p><p>This rule is founded on the following data. As a gallon of water weighs\n10 lbs., it is obvious that the specific gravity of any liquid\nmultiplied by 10 will give the weight of one gallon. The specific\ngravity of absolute alcohol is 0.793811; hence, the weight of one gallon\nwill be 7.93811 lbs., and its strength is estimated at 75.25 overproof.</p><p>\n4 equivalents of alcohol = 46 × 4 = 184,<br>\n<br>\nand<br>\n<br>\n23.17936 gallons × 7.93811 lbs. per gallon, also = 184.0003094.<br>\n</p><p>Hence it appears that 23.17936 gallons of absolute alcohol <a></a>are equal to\n4 equivalents. By adding the overproof per centage (75.25) to 100, and\nmultiplying by the quantity (23.17936 gallons) we get the constant\nnumber 4062.183.</p><p>The rule might have been calculated so as to show <i>at once</i> the\nequivalent, without dividing by 4; but it would have required several\nmore places of decimals; it will give the required quantity to a\nfraction of a fluid drachm.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"PURIFICATION_OF_SPIRITS\"></a>PURIFICATION OF SPIRITS BY FILTRATION.</h3><h4>BY MR. W. SCHAEFFER.</h4><p>Instead of resorting to repeated distillations for effecting the\npurification of spirits, Mr. Schaeffer proposes the use of a filter. In\na suitable vessel, the form of which is not material, a filtering bed is\nconstructed in the following manner:—On a false perforated bottom,\ncovered with woollen or other fabric, a layer of about six inches of\nwell-washed and very clean river sand is placed; next about twelve\ninches of granular charcoal, preferring that made from birch; on the\ncharcoal is placed a layer of about one inch of wheat, boiled to such an\nextent as to cause it to swell as large as possible, and so that it will\nreadily crush between the fingers. Above this is laid about ten inches\nof charcoal, then about one inch of broken oyster shells, and then about\ntwo inches more of charcoal, over which is placed a layer of woollen or\nother fabric, and over it a perforated partition, on to which the spirit\nto be filtered is poured; the filter is kept covered, and in order that\nthe spirit may flow freely into the compartment of the filter below the\nfiltering materials, a tube connects such lower compartment with the\nupper compartment of the filter, so that the air <a></a>may pass freely\nbetween the lower and upper compartments of the filter. On each, of the\nseveral strata above described, it is desirable to place a layer of\nfiltering paper.</p><p>The charcoal suitable for the above purpose is not such as is obtained\nin the ordinary mode of preparation. It is placed in a retort or oven,\nand heated to a red heat until the blue flame has passed off, and the\nflame become red. The charcoal is then cooled in water, in which\ncarbonate of potash has previously been dissolved, in the proportion of\ntwo ounces of carbonate to fifty gallons of water. The charcoal being\ndeprived of the water is then reduced to a granular state, in which\ncondition it is ready for use.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"ON_ESSENTIAL_OIL_OR_OTTO_OF_LEMONS\"></a>ON ESSENTIAL OIL OR OTTO OF LEMONS.</h3><h4>BY JOHN S. COBB.</h4><p>(<i>Read before the Chemical Discussion Society.</i>)</p><p>I have recently made some experiments with oil of lemons, of which the\nfollowing is a short account:—</p><p>Being constantly annoyed by the deposit and alteration in my essence of\nlemons, I have tried various methods of remedying the inconvenience.</p><p>I first tried redistilling it, but besides the loss consequent on\ndistilling small quantities, the flavor is thereby impaired. As the oil\nbecame brighter when heated, I anticipated that all its precipitable\nmatter would be thrown down at a low temperature, and I applied a\nfreezing mixture, keeping the oil at zero for some hours. No such\nchange, however, took place.</p><p>The plan which I ultimately decided upon as the best <a></a>which I had\narrived at, was to shake up the oil with a little boiling water, and to\nleave the water in the bottle; a mucilaginous preparation forms on the\ntop of the water, and acquires a certain tenacity, so that the oil may\nbe poured off to nearly the last, without disturbing the deposit.\nPerhaps cold water would answer equally well, were it carefully agitated\nwith the oil and allowed some time to settle. A consideration of its\norigin and constitution, indeed, strengthens this opinion; for although\nlemon otto is obtained both by distillation and expression, that which\nis usually found in commerce is prepared by removing the \"flavedo\" of\nlemons with a rasp, and afterwards expressing it in a hair sack,\nallowing the filtrate to stand, that it may deposit some of its\nimpurities, decanting and filtering. Thus obtained it still contains a\ncertain amount of mucilaginous matter, which undergoes spontaneous\ndecomposition, and thus (acting, in short, as a ferment) accelerates a\nsimilar change in the oil itself. If this view of its decomposition be a\ncorrect one, we evidently, in removing this matter by means of the\nwater, get rid of a great source of alteration, and attain the same\nresult as we should by distillation, without its waste or deterioration\nin flavor.</p><p>I am, however, aware that some consider the deposit to be modified\nresin.<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_H_8\">[H]</a> Some curious experiments of Saussure have shown that volatile\noils absorb oxygen immediately they have been drawn from the plant, and\nare partially converted <a></a>into a resin, which remains dissolved in the\nremainder of the essence.</p><p>He remarked that this property of absorbing oxygen gradually increases,\nuntil a maximum is attained, and again diminishes after a certain lapse\nof time. In the oil of lavender this maximum remained only seven days,\nduring each of which it absorbed seven times its volume of oxygen. In\nthe oil of lemons the maximum was not attained until at the end of a\nmonth; it then lasted twenty-six days; during each of which it absorbed\ntwice its volume of oxygen. The oil of turpentine did not attain the\nmaximum for five months, it then remained for one month, during which\ntime it absorbed daily its own volume of oxygen.</p><p>It is the resin formed by the absorption of oxygen, and remaining\ndissolved in the essence, which destroys its original flavor. The oil of\nlemons presents a very great analogy with that of oil of turpentine, so\nfar as regards its transformations, and its power of rotating a ray of\npolarized light. Authorities differ as regards this latter property.\nPereira states that the oil of turpentine obtained by distillation with\nwater, from American turpentine, has a molecular power of right-handed\nrotation, while the French oil of turpentine had a left-handed rotation.\nOil of lemons rotates a ray of light to the right, but in France a\ndistilled oil of lemons, sold as scouring drops for removing spots of\ngrease, possesses quite the opposite power of rotation, and has lost all\nthe original peculiar flavor of the oil. Oil of lemons combines with\nhydrochloric acid to form an artificial camphor, just in the same manner\nas does oil of turpentine, but its atom is only one half that of the oil\nof turpentine. The artificial camphor of oil of lemons is represented by\nthe formula, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>HCl; the artificial camphor of oil of turpentine\nby C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>16</sub>HCl.</p><p><a></a>According to M. Biot, the camphor formed by the oil of lemons does not\nexercise any action on polarized light, whilst the oil of lemons itself\nrotates a ray to the right. The camphor from oil of turpentine, on the\ncontrary, does exercise on the polarized ray the same power as the oil\npossessed while in its isolated state, of rotating to the left. These\nmolecular properties establish an essential difference between the oils\nof turpentine and lemons, and may serve to detect adulteration and\nfraud. It is also a curious fact, that from the decomposition of these\nartificial camphors by lime, volatile oils may be obtained by\ndistillation, isomeric with the original oils from which the camphors\nwere formed; but in neither case has the new product any action on\npolarized light.</p><p>In conclusion, I would recommend that this oil, as well as all other\nessential oils, be kept in a cool, dark place, where no very great\nchanges of temperature occur.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"BENZOIC_ACID_AND_TESTS_FOR_ITS_PURITY\"></a>BENZOIC ACID, AND TESTS FOR ITS PURITY.</h3><h4>BY W. BASTICK.</h4><p>Dr. Mohr's process for obtaining benzoic acid, which is adopted by the\nPrussian Pharmacopœia, unquestionably has the reputation of being the\nbest. According to this process, coarsely-powdered gum benzoin is to be\nstrewed on the flat bottom of a round iron pot which has a diameter of\nnine inches, and a height of about two inches. On the surface of the pot\nis spread a piece of filtering paper, which is fastened to its rim by\nstarch paste. A cylinder of very thick paper is attached by means of a\nstring to the top of <a></a>the iron pot. Heat is then applied by placing the\npot on a plate covered with sand, over the mouth of a furnace. It must\nremain exposed to a gentle fire from four to six hours. Mohr usually\nobtains about an ounce and a half of benzoic acid from twelve ounces of\ngum benzoin by the first sublimation. As the gum is not exhausted by the\nfirst operation, it may be bruised when cold and again submitted to the\naction of heat, when a fresh portion of benzoic acid will sublime from\nit. This acid thus obtained, is not perfectly pure and white, and Mohr\nstates that it is a question, in a medicinal and perfumery point of\nview, whether it is so valuable when perfectly pure, as when it contains\na small portion of a fragrant volatile oil, which rises with it from the\ngum in the process of sublimation.</p><p>The London Pharmacopœia directs that it shall be prepared by\nsublimation, and does not prescribe that it shall be free from this oil,\nto which it principally owes its agreeable odor.</p><p>By the second sublimation the whole of the benzoic acid is not\nvolatilized. What remains in the resin may be separated by boiling it\nwith caustic lime, and precipitating the acid from the resulting\nbenzoate of lime with hydrochloric acid. Benzoic acid can be obtained\nalso in the wet way, and the resin yields a greater product in this\nprocess than in the former; yet it has a less perfumery value, because\nit is free from the volatile oil which, as above stated, gives it its\npeculiar odor. The wet method devised by Scheele is as follows:—Make\none ounce of freshly-burnt lime into a milk with from four to six ounces\nof hot water. To the milk of lime, four ounces of powdered benzoin and\nthirty ounces of water are to be added, and the mixture boiled for half\nan hour, and stirred during this operation, and afterwards strained\nthrough linen. The <a></a>residue must be a second time boiled with twenty\nounces of water and strained, and a third time with ten ounces; the\nfluid products must be mixed and evaporated to one-fourth of their\nvolume, and sufficient hydrochloric acid added to render them slightly\nacid. When quite cold, the crystals are to be separated from the fluid\nby means of a linen strainer, upon which they are to be washed with cold\nwater, and pressed, and then dissolved in hot distilled water, from\nwhich the crystals separate on cooling. When hydrochloric acid is added\nto a cold concentrated solution of the salts of benzoic acid, it is\nprecipitated as a white powder. If the solution of the salts of this\nacid is too dilute and warm, none or only a portion of the benzoic acid\nwill be separated. However, the weaker the solution is, and the more\nslowly it is cooled, the larger will be the crystals of this acid. In\nthe preparation of this acid in the wet way, lime is to be preferred to\nevery other base, because it forms insoluble combinations with the\nresinous constituents of the benzoin, and because it prevents the\ngum-resin from conglomerating into an adhesive mass, and also because an\nexcess of this base is but slightly soluble.</p><p>Stoltze has recommended a method by which all the acid can be removed\nfrom the benzoin:—The resin is to be dissolved in spirit, to which is\nto be added a watery solution of carbonate of soda, decomposed\npreviously by alcohol. The spirit is to be removed by distillation, and\nthe remaining watery solution, from which the resin has been separated\nby filtration, treated with dilute sulphuric acid, to precipitate the\nbenzoic acid. This method gives the greatest quantity of acid, but is\nattended with a sacrifice of time and alcohol, which renders it in an\neconomical point of view inferior to the above process of Scheele. It\nis so far valuable, that the total acid contents of the resin can be\ndetermined by it.</p><p>Dr. Gregory considers the following process for obtaining benzoic acid\nthe most productive. Dissolve benzoin in strong alcohol, by the aid of\nheat, and add to the solution, whilst hot, hydrochloric acid, in\nsufficient quantity to precipitate the resin. When the mixture is\ndistilled, the benzoic acid passes over in the form of benzoic ether.\nDistillation must be continued as long as any ether passes over. Water\nadded towards the end of the operation will facilitate the expulsion of\nthe ether from the retort. When the ether ceases to pass over, the hot\nwater in the retort is filtered, which deposits benzoic acid on cooling.\nThe benzoic ether and all the distilled liquids are now treated with\ncaustic potash until the ether is decomposed, and the solution is heated\nto boiling, and super-saturated with hydrochloric acid, which\nafterwards, on cooling, deposits, in crystals, benzoic acid.</p><p>Benzoic acid, as it exists in the resin, is the natural production of\nthe plant from which the resin is derived. It may also be produced\nartificially. Abel found that when cumole (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) was treated\nwith nitric acid, so dilute that no red vapors were evolved for several\ndays, this hydro-carbon was converted into benzoic acid. Guckelberger\nhas, by the oxidation of casein with peroxide of manganese and sulphuric\nacid, obtained as one of the products benzoic acid. Albumen, fibrin, and\ngelatin yielded similar results when treated as above. Wöhler has\ndetected benzoic acid in Canadian castor, along with salicin. It is also\nformed by the oxidation of the volatile oil of bitter almonds. Benzoate\nof potash results when chloride of benzoyle is treated with caustic\npotash. Benzoic acid in the animal economy is converted into hippuric\nacid, which may by the action of acids, be reconverted into benzoic\nacid.</p><p>Benzoic acid should be completely volatile, without leaving any ash or\nbeing carbonized when heated. When dissolved in warm water, to which a\nlittle nitric acid has been added, nitrate of silver and chloride of\nbarium should produce no precipitates. Oxalate of potash should give no\nturbidity to an ammoniacal solution of this acid. When heated with an\nexcess of caustic potash it should evolve no smell of ammonia,\notherwise, it has been adulterated with sal ammoniac. In spirit, benzoic\nacid is easily soluble, and requires 200 parts of cold and 20 parts of\nboiling water to dissolve one part of it.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"ON_THE_COLORING-MATTERS_OF_FLOWERS\"></a>ON THE COLORING-MATTERS OF FLOWERS.</h3><h4>BY FREMY AND CLOEZ.</h4><p>Chemists possess only a very incomplete knowledge of the coloring\nmatters of flowers. Their investigation involves difficulties which\ncannot be mistaken. The matters which color flowers are uncrystallized;\nthey frequently change by the action of the reagents employed for their\npreparation; and, also, very brilliantly-colored flowers owe their color\nto very small quantities of coloring matter.</p><p>On the nature of the coloring matters of flowers several opinions have\nbeen expressed. Some observers have assumed that flowers owe their color\nto only two coloring matters, one of which is termed anthocyan, and the\nother anthoxanthine. Others will find a relation between the green\ncoloring of leaves, the chlorophylle, and the coloring matters of\nflowers. They support their opinion generally on the results <a></a>of the\nelementary analysis of those different bodies; but all chemists know\nthat chlorophylle has not yet been prepared in a pure condition.\nProbably, it retains various quantities of fatty and albuminous bodies.\nFurther, the coloring matters of flowers are scarcely known, so that it\nis impossible to establish relations supported by the necessarily\nuncertain composition of impure bodies.</p><p>Some time since the blue color of flowers was ascribed to the presence\nof indigo; but Chevreul has shown, in a certain way, that the blue\nsubstance of flowers is always reddened by acids; and that with indigo\nit is quite different, which, as is known, retains its blue color even\nwhen the strongest acids are allowed to act on it.</p><p>It is thus seen that the coloring matters of flowers have heretofore\nonly in a superficial manner been examined, and that it is important to\nagain undertake their complete examination, as these bodies are\ninteresting to the chemist, because they are employed as reagents in the\nlaboratory for the recognition of alkalies; and by an improved knowledge\nof them the florist might find the way by which he could give to\ncultivated flowers various colors.</p><p>We have believed that before undertaking their elementary analysis,\nmethods must be carefully sought for which can be followed for the\nobtainment of the coloring matters of flowers, and that it should be\nproved whether these substances are to be considered as independent\nbodies, or whether they proceed from one and the same matter, which is\nchanged in various ways by the juices of the plant.</p><p>We now publish the results of our first investigations.</p><p><i>Blue Coloring Matter of Flowers (Cyanine).</i>—The blue coloring matter\nof flowers we propose to call cyanine. To obtain this substance we treat\nthe petals of <i>Centauria cyanus</i>,<a></a> <i>Viola odorata</i>, or <i>Iris\npseudacorus</i>, with boiling alcohol, by which the flowers are\ndecolorized; and the liquid acquires immediately a fine blue color.</p><p>If the coloring matter is allowed to remain some time in contact with\nalcohol, it is perceived that the blue of the liquid gradually\ndisappears, and soon a yellow brown coloration takes its place. The\ncoloring matter has in this case suffered an actual reduction by the\nprolonged action of the alcohol, but it will again assume its original\ncolor when the alcohol is allowed to evaporate in the air. Nevertheless,\nthe alcohol must not be allowed to remain in contact too long with the\ncoloring matter, because the alcoholic extract will not then again\nassume its blue coloration by the action of oxygen.</p><p>The residue remaining from the evaporation of the alcohol is treated\nwith water, which separates a fatty and resinous substance. The watery\nsolution which contains the coloring matter is then precipitated by\nneutral acetate of lead. The precipitate, which possesses a beautiful\ngreen color, can be washed with plenty of water, and then decomposed\nwith sulphuretted hydrogen; the coloring matter passes into the watery\nsolution, which is carefully evaporated in a water-bath; the residue is\nagain dissolved in absolute alcohol; and lastly, the alcoholic solution\nis mixed with ether, which precipitates the cyanine in the form of blue\nflocks.</p><p>Cyanine is uncrystallizable, soluble in water and alcohol, insoluble in\nether; acids, and acid salts color it immediately red; by alkalies it\nis, as known, colored green. Cyanine appears to behave as an acid, at\nleast it forms with lime, baryta, strontia, oxide of lead, &amp;c., green\ncompounds insoluble in water.</p><p>Bodies absorbing oxygen, as sulphurous acid, phosphorous <a></a>acid, and\nalcohols, decolorize it; under the influence of oxygen its color is\nrestored.</p><p>We must here mention that Moroz has prepared a beautiful blue substance\nfrom <i>Centauria cyanus</i> by treatment with absolute alcohol.</p><p><i>Rose-red Coloring Matter.</i>—We have employed alcohol to extract the\nsubstance which colors rose-red certain dahlias, roses, pœonias, &amp;c.\nFor the procuration of this coloring matter the method pursued is\nexactly as that for the preparation of cyanine.</p><p>By an attentive comparison of the properties of this coloring matter\nwith those of cyanine, we have found that the rose-red coloring matter\nis the same as the blue, or at least results from a modification of the\nsame independent principle. It appears in the rose-red modification,\nwhen the juice of the plant, with which it exists in contact, possesses\nan acid reaction. We have always observed this acid reaction in the\njuices of plants with red or rose-red coloration, while the blue juices\nof plants have always exhibited an alkaline reaction.</p><p>We have exposed most of the rose-red or red-colored flowers which are\ncultivated in the Paris Museum to the influence of alkalies, and have\nseen that they first become blue and then green by their action.</p><p>It is often perceived that certain rose-red flowers, as those of the\n<i>Mallow</i>, and in particular those of the <i>Hibiscus Syriacus</i>, acquire by\nfading a blue and then a green coloration, which change, as we have\nfound, depends on the decomposition of an organic nitrogenous substance,\nwhich is found very frequently in the petals. This body generates as it\ndecomposes ammonia, which communicates to the flowers the blue or green\ncolor. By action of weak acids, the petals can be restored to their\nrose-red color.</p><p><a></a>The alteration of color of certain rose-red flowers can also be\nobserved when the petals are very rapidly dried, for example, in\n<i>vacuo</i>, by which it cannot be easily assumed that a nitrogenous body\nhas undergone decomposition to the evolution of ammonia. But, before all\nthings, it must be mentioned that in this case the modification of color\npasses into violet, and never arrives at green; and, further, that it is\nalways accompanied with the evolution of carbonic acid, which we have\ndetected by a direct experiment. Petals which were before rose-red, and\nhave become violet by slight drying, evolve carbonic acid, and on that\naccount it may be assumed that the rose-red color is produced in the\npetals by this carbonic acid, and that by its expulsion the petals\nassume the blue color, by which the flowers with neutral juices are\ncharacterized.</p><p>We believe that we are able to speak with certainty that flowers with a\nrose-red, violet, or blue color, owe their coloration to one and the\nsame substance, but which is modified in various ways by the influence\nof the juices of plants.</p><p>Scarlet-red flowers also contain cyanine reddened by an acid, but in\nsuch cases this substance is mixed with a yellow coloring matter which\nwe will now describe.</p><p><i>Yellow Coloring Matter.</i>—The simplest experiments show that no analogy\nexists between the substance which colors flowers yellow and that of\nwhich we have already spoken. The agents which generate so easily with\ncyanine, the rose-red, violet, or green coloration, cannot in any case\nimpart these colors to the yellow substance obtained from flowers.</p><p>By the examination of the various yellow-colored flowers, we have\nascertained that they owe their coloration to two substances, which\ndiffer from one another in their properties, and appear not to be\nderived from the same independent principle. One is completely insoluble\nin water, <a></a>which we have termed xanthine, a name which Runge has given\nto a yellow matter from madder. As this name has not been accepted in\nscience, we have employed it to denote one of the coloring matters of\nyellow flowers. The other substance is very soluble in water, and is by\nus termed xantheine.</p><p><i>Xanthine, or the Yellow Coloring Matter insoluble in water.</i>—We have\nprepared this coloring matter from many yellow flowers, but chiefly from\n<i>Helianthus annuus</i>.</p><p>To obtain it we treat the flowers with boiling absolute alcohol, which\ndissolves the coloring matter in the heat, and by cooling almost\ncompletely allows it again to precipitate. The yellow deposit which is\nobtained in this way, is not pure xanthine, as it contains a rather\nconsiderable quantity of oil. To separate this oil we have recourse to a\nmoderate saponification; thus, we heat the yellow precipitate with a\nsmall quantity of alkali to saponify the fatty body mixed with the\nxanthine, which even contains the xanthine dissolved. As the coloring\nmatter is soluble in the soap solution, we do not treat the mass with\nwater, but decompose it with an acid which isolates the xanthine and the\nfatty acids resulting from the saponification. This precipitate we treat\nwith cold alcohol, which leaves behind the fatty acids, and dissolves\nthe xanthine. This substance is a fine yellow color, insoluble in water,\nbut soluble in alcohol and ether, which are thereby colored golden\nyellow. It appears to be uncrystallizable, and possesses the general\nproperties of resins.</p><p>Xanthine, in combination with cyanine, modified by the various juices of\nplants, communicates in variable proportions orange-yellow, scarlet-red,\nand red colors to flowers.</p><p><i>Xantheine, or the Coloring Matter soluble in water.</i>—By <a></a>the\npreparation of the substance which colors yellow certain dahlias, it is\nat once perceived that it has no analogy to xanthine. The latter is as\nknown insoluble in water, while the coloring matter under consideration\nis readily soluble in water.</p><p>To obtain the xanthine we treat the petals of yellow flowering dahlias\nwith alcohol, which quickly dissolves the yellow coloring matter,\nbesides the fat and resin. The solution is evaporated to dryness, and\nthe residue treated with water, whereby the fat and resin are separated.\nThe water is again evaporated to dryness, and the residue treated with\nabsolute alcohol. The resulting solution diluted with water is mixed\nwith neutral acetate of lead, which precipitates the coloring matters.\nThe lead precipitate is then decomposed with sulphuric acid, upon which\nthe xantheine which remains dissolved in the water is purified by\nalcohol.</p><p>Xantheine is soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but crystallizes from\nnone of these solutions. Alkalies color it intensely brown. Its power of\ncoloration is considerable. It dyes various fabrics of a yellow tone,\nwhich is without brilliancy. Acids again destroy the brown coloration\nproduced by alkalies. Xantheine combines with most metallic bases, and\nforms therewith yellow or brown insoluble lakes.</p><p>The facts here related agree with all which has been previously observed\nregarding the coloring matters of flowers. It is known that blue flowers\ncan become red, and even white, where their coloring matter is\ndestroyed, but never yellow—and <i>vice versâ</i>. These three coloring\nmatters can generate the colors either alone or by admixture, which are\nseen in flowers; but whether they are the only matters which color\nflowers, we are at present unable to determine.—<i>Journal de\nPharmacie.</i></p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"IMPROVED_PROCESS_FOR\"></a>IMPROVED PROCESS FOR BLEACHING BEES'-WAX AND THE FATTY ACIDS.</h3><h4>BY MR. G.F. WILSON.</h4><p>This improved process consists of two parts:—1st, the application of\nhighly-heated steam to heat the fatty matters under treatment, by which\nmeans the requisite heat for melting these substances is obtained, and\nat the same time the atmosphere is thereby excluded; the heated steam so\napplied in its passage off, carries with it the offensive smells given\noff by the fatty matters, and being made to traverse a pipe or passage\nup or along which gaseous chlorine is allowed to flow, a complete\ndisinfection of the offensive products is thereby effected. 2dly, the\ntreating of bees'-wax in a mixture of hard acid fat and bees'-wax, with\ncompounds of chlorine and oxygen, preferring to employ that disengaged\nfrom chlorate of potash by treating it with sulphuric acid. For this\npurpose, Mr. Wilson takes at the rate, say, of a ton of yellow\nbees'-wax, and melts and boils it up with free steam for about half an\nhour. It is then allowed to stand a short time, and is then decanted\ninto another vessel provided with a steam-pipe to emit free steam; about\n20 lbs. of chlorate of potash is added, and the steam turned on; 80 lbs.\nof sulphuric acid, diluted with a like weight of water, is then\ngradually added. The matters are allowed to stand for a short time, and\nare then decanted into another vessel, and again boiled up with free\nsteam, and treated with a like quantity of diluted sulphuric acid. The\nbees'-wax is then decanted into a receiver, and is ready for use. The\nbees'-wax may, before undergoing these processes, be combined and boiled\nup with a hard fatty acid, and then treated as above described.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"CHEMICAL_EXAMINATION_OF_NAPLES\"></a>CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF NAPLES SOAP.</h3><p>A.

All this roundabout method of doing business is\nnow done away with, and no restriction now exists to mar the peace of\nthe soap manufacturer.</p><p>Amongst various new processes lately introduced is that of Mr. H.C.\nJennings, which is practically carried out in the following manner:—</p><p>Combine 1000 lbs. of stearic or margaric acid, as free from elaine or\noleine as possible, or palmatine, or any vegetable or animal stearine or\nmargarine, at the temperature of 212° Fahr., with a solution of\nbicarbonate of potash or soda, specific gravity 1500. Constantly stir or\nmix until an intimate combination is obtained, and that the elements\nwill not part when tried upon glass or any other similar substance. When\nthe mass is cooled down to about 60° Fahr. add one pound per cent. of\nliquor ammoniæ, specific gravity 880, and one pound per cent. of\nstrongest solution of caustic potash; these are to be added gradually,\nand fully mixed or stirred until perfectly combined. Dissolve 15 to 18\npounds per cent. of common resin of commerce, by boiling it with a\nsolution of subcarbonate of potash and common soda of commerce, in equal\nparts, as much as will give the solution a specific gravity of about\n1800, when boiling hot. Mix these perfectly with the above-mentioned\nstearic or margaric acids, and carbonated alkali; then add a strong\n<a></a>solution of caustic potash or soda, until a perfect saponification is\nproduced. The dose of caustic alkali will much depend upon the purity of\nthe stearine or margarine employed. The separation is now effected by\nusing common salt, or sulphate of soda, &amp;c., as is known and practised\nby soap manufacturers. If the soap intended to be produced is to be\ncolorless, no resin must be employed, and a larger dose of liquor\nammoniæ and caustic alkali must be used, according to the dryness of the\nstearine matters to be operated upon.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"A_SIMPLE_AND_CERTAIN_METHOD_TO_DETERMINE\"></a>A SIMPLE AND CERTAIN METHOD TO DETERMINE THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF SOAP.</h3><h4>BY DR. ALEXANDER MÜLLER.</h4><p>In consequence of the ceremonious process by which the fatty acids are\ndetermined in one portion of the soap, and the alkali by the\nincineration of another, I consider the following method is not unworthy\nof publication, because it appears to afford quicker and more correct\nresults by reason of the greater simplicity of the manipulation. It is\navailable principally for soda soaps, which are the most common; but it\nmay be also employed with corresponding alterations for soaps which have\nother bases.</p><p>A piece of soap weighing two or three grammes is dissolved in a tared\nbeaker glass of about 160 cubic centimetres capacity with 80 to 100\ncubic centimetres of water, by heat, in a water-bath, and then three or\nfour times the quantity of diluted sulphuric acid or as much as is\nnecessary to decompose the soap, added from a burette. When, <a></a>after\nrepeated agitation, the fatty acids have separated in a transparent\nclear stratum from the aqueous solution, it is allowed to cool, and then\nthe contents of the beaker glass are placed in a moistened filter, which\nhas been previously dried at 212° Fahr. and weighed. The contents of the\nfilter are washed until their acid reaction disappears. In the meanwhile\nthe beaker glass is placed in a steam-bath, so that, it being already\ndry, may support the washed and partly dry filter, which is laid on the\nmouth of the glass as if it were in the funnel. The fatty acids soon\npass through the paper, and for the most part flow ultimately to the\nbottom of the beaker glass; the increase of weight of which, after\ncooling, and the subtraction of the weight of the filter, gives the\nquantity of fatty acids present in the soap. A second drying and\nweighing is not necessary, if on the cold sides of the interior of the\nglass no damp is to be observed, which is occasioned by a trace of water\nstill present. If the quantity of oxide of iron added to marble the soap\nis considerable, it may be easily found by incinerating the filter and\ndetermining the weight of the residue.</p><p>The fluid runs from the fatty acids on the filter, which, with the\nwashings, has been preserved in a sufficiently large beaker glass, is\ncolored with tincture of litmus, and decomposed with a test alkaline\nsolution until the blue color appears. The difference of the quantity of\nalkali required to neutralize the sulphuric acid, and the quantity of\nsulphuric acid used in the first instance, allows a calculation to be\nmade as to the quantity of effective alkali in the soap, for example:—</p><p>\n23.86 grms. of soap (partly cocoa-nut oil soap).<br>\n17.95    \"     fatty acids with filter.<br>\n04.44    \"     filter.<br>\n-----<br>\n13.51 grms. of hydrates of fatty acids = 56.62 per cent.<br>\n<br>\n28.00 cub. cent. of the diluted sulphuric acid applied for the<br><a></a>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 5em;\">decomposition of the soap, of which 100 cub. cent.</span><br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 5em;\">represent 2982 grms. of carbonate of soda.</span><br>\n<br>\n17.55 cub. cent. of alkaline fluid, which were used for the<br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 5em;\">saturation of the above acid, and of which 100 cub.</span><br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 5em;\">cent. saturate an equal quantity of that acid.</span><br>\n----<br>\n10.45 cub. cent. of the sulphuric necessary for the alkali<br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 5em;\">contained in the soap, representing 0.1823 grms. of</span><br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 5em;\">soda = 7.64 per cent.</span><br>\n</p><p>A determination of the alkali as a sulphate afforded in another portion\nof soap 9.57 per cent. of soda, because the sulphate of soda and\nchloride of sodium present in the soap gave up their alkali.</p><p>The alkaline fluid applied by me was a saccharine solution of lime,\nwhich can be naturally replaced by a solution of soda, and must be if\nthe chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda mixed with the soap shall be\ndetermined in the following way:—</p><p>The fluid again exactly neutralized with alkali is evaporated to\ndryness, and the residue gently heated to redness. As in the above\nmanipulation, the fluid was not heated to the boiling point, the\noriginal chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda are contained in the\nweighed residue, besides the soda of the soap and that which has been\nadded with the sulphuric acid, forming sulphate of soda. A second\nexposure to a red heat with sulphuric acid converts the whole residue\ninto sulphate of soda, and from the increase of weight, by a comparison\nof the equivalents of NaCl and NaO, SO<sub>3</sub> the quantity of the former\nmay be decided. According to the equivalents which Kopp furnished in\n1850, the increase of weight to the chloride of sodium is as 1:4.68. The\noriginal sulphate of soda must be, lastly, found <a></a>by the subtraction of\nthe same salt formed plus the calculated chloride of sodium from the\nfirst heated residue.</p><p>In practice, it is seldom necessary to proceed with the determination of\nthe chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda, except with stirred and\ncocoa-nut oil soaps; certainly less of the truth is seen if, after the\nabove determination of the fatty acids and the effective alkali, the\nabsent per centage of water is introduced in the calculation, than if\nthe water is reckoned, which is never completely evolved from soap, even\ntechnically prepared at 302° Fahr., and another determination made of\nthe fatty acids or alkali <i>en bloc</i> the fatty acids, or even the\nalkaline contents.</p><p>The method here given partakes of the usual imperfections, that the\nfatty acids as well as the unsaponified soap are equally estimated, and\nthe mixed hydrate or carbonate of the alkali as well as the combined\nalkali. The presence of the carbonate can be easily recognized by the\nfoaming of the soap solution, upon the addition of the sulphuric acid.\nThese imperfections, however, are of little importance.</p><p>It must be granted that the minutely correct determination of the\nconstitution of soap must be always yielded up to those who are\ntechnically conversant with this department of chemistry, the estimation\nof free alkali and unchanged fat excluded in, at least, by certain ages\nof the soap. Further, a considerable excess of one or another ingredient\nsoon betrays itself by a corresponding departure in the soap of the\ncharacteristic properties of a good product, and a small excess can be\njudged sufficiently exact from the proportion of the alkali, which,\nsupposing soda present, should not amount to more than 13 per cent. with\na pure cocoa-nut oil soap, not less than 11.5 per cent. with a tallow\nsoap; but with palm oil and mixed soaps the one or the other limit\napproximates.—<i>Journal für Praktische Chemie.</i></p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"ON_THE_NATURAL_FATS\"></a>ON THE NATURAL FATS.</h3><h4>BY DR. CHARLES LÖWIG.</h4><p>The fats which exist in nature can be divided into the general and the\nspecial; the former exist in almost all plants and parts of plants; the\nlatter includes only some vegetable substances, as <i>laurostearine</i>,\n<i>myristicine</i>, and <i>palmatine</i>. The consistence of fats of the general\nkind depend upon the proportions of margarine, stearine, and oleine\ncontained in them. The former preponderate in the solid fats (butter,\nlard, and tallow); and the latter in the fluid ones or oils. According\nas an oil contains oleic acid or olinic acid, it is termed a fatty or\ndrying oil. To the class of fatty oils belong olive, almond, hazel-nut,\nbeech, rape oils, &amp;c.; to that of drying oils, linseed, nut, hemp,\npoppy, grape-seed, oils, &amp;c.; which are used for varnishes.</p><p>In the vegetable kingdom the fats are chiefly in the seeds and in their\ncoverings, seldom in the perispemium (poppy), and in the fleshy\nsubstance surrounding the seed (olive). The fat in the seed is mostly\nenclosed in cells with a proteine compound. In the animal kingdom\ncertain parts of the body are quite filled with fat-cells, particularly\nunder the skin (<i>Paniculus adiposus</i>), in the cavities of the abdomen,\nin the so-called <i>omentum</i>, in the kidneys and the tubulated canals of\nthe bones. Fat is also enclosed in cells (fatty globules) in milk.</p><p>It is established, without a doubt, that a greater portion of the fat\nwhich exists in the animal kingdom originates from the vegetable\nkingdom, for it is introduced into the body cotemporaneously with the\nproteine compounds of that kingdom. A portion of the fat as well as wax\nis formed in <a></a>the animal organismus, as shown by a number of\nobservations, and in most cases it is unquestionable that the\nnon-nitrogenous nutriments, as starch, serve for the formation of fat by\na process of deoxidation; nevertheless, the formation of fat in the\nanimal body appears only to take place when the substances containing\nstarch enter the body simultaneously with fat.</p><p>If the fat existing in the animal body is contained in cellular tissue,\nits separation may be simply effected by placing the incised tissue in\nhot water. The cells burst and the fat collects itself on the surface of\nthe water. If vegetable substances contain fat in large quantity, as,\nfor example, seeds, it may be obtained by expression. The dried seeds\nare bruised and expressed between either cold or hot metallic plates.\nOlives are laid in heaps before expression; when they begin to ferment,\nthey can be completely expressed. If animal and vegetable substances\ncontain only a little fat, it must be extracted by ether.</p><p>In the pure condition the fats are mostly odorless and tasteless; when\nthey possess an odor, it arises mostly from the presence of small\nquantities of volatile fatty acids, as butyric acid, capric acid, &amp;c.;\nwhich becomes free through the decomposition of their oxide of glycyl\ncombinations. This ensues by the presence of water and air through a\nkind of fermentation, and as it appears, by the presence of a\nnitrogenous substance. The fats are insoluble in water, and, with the\nexception of castor oil, are taken up by cold alcohol in very small\nquantities, however, more in proportion as they contain oleine. In\nboiling alcohol they are dissolved, but are, for the most part, again\nseparated on cooling, particularly those rich in stearine. All fats are\ntaken up by ether but those containing stearine in the smallest\nquantity.</p><p><a></a>Their specific gravities fluctuate between .91 and .93. When heated,\nfats assume a dark color, and boil between 482° and 572° Fahr., but the\nboiling-point continuously rises, while an uninterrupted decomposition\nproceeds. From oxide of glycyl ensues acroline; oleic acid affords a\nfatty acid, and among the decomposition products of fats containing\nstearine and margarine are found pure margaric acid, and, at the same\ntime, some hydro-carbons are formed. When exposed quickly to a high\ntemperature, fats are completely decomposed. (Oil gas.) In closed\nvessels the pure fats undergo no change, but, placed in thin layers in\nthe air, the fats containing oleine and oline rapidly absorb oxygen\nunder the strong evolution of heat, which will inflame porous bodies, as\ncotton wool. The purer the fats are the more quickly their oxidation\nresults. When the fats contain slimy materials, these latter can be\ndestroyed with a little oxide of lead and water. (Preparation for the\napplication of varnishes.) The action of nitric acid, nitrous acid,\nchlorine, sulphuric acid, &amp;c., on fats is the same as that of these\nbodies on the fatty acids. The fatty oils dissolve sulphur in the heat\nwhich is again partly precipitated on cooling. When sulphur is heated\nwith fatty oils, namely, with linseed oil, it dissolves by degrees, and\na thick dark mass is formed, the so-called balsam of sulphur. By raising\nthe heat, a violent reaction ensues under the evolution of sulphuretted\nhydrogen, and, at the same time, an oil resembling oil of garlic\nvolatilizes. This oil begins to boil at 160° Fahr., but its\nboiling-point rises continually.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"PERFUMES_AS_PREVENTIVES\"></a>PERFUMES AS PREVENTIVES OF MOULDINESS.</h3><p>An interesting paper on this subject has been published by Dr.\nMacculloch. We presume our readers are aware that mouldiness is\noccasioned by the growth of minute vegetables. Ink, paste, leather, and\nseeds, are the substances that most frequently suffer from it. The\neffect of cloves in preserving ink is well known; any of the essential\noils answer equally well. Leather may be kept free from mould by the\nsame substances. Thus Russian leather, which is perfumed with the tar of\nbirch, never becomes mouldy; indeed it prevents it from occurring in\nother bodies. A few drops of any essential oil are sufficient also to\nkeep books entirely free from it. For harness, oil of turpentine is\nrecommended. Bookbinders, in general, employ alum for preserving their\npaste; but mould frequently forms on it. Shoemakers' resin is sometimes\nalso used for the same purpose; but it is less effectual than oil of\nturpentine. The best preventives, however, are the essential oils, even\nin small quantity, as those of peppermint, anise, or cassia, by which\npaste may be kept almost any length of time; indeed, it has, in this\nway, been preserved for years. The paste recommended by Dr. Macculloch\nis made in the usual way, with flour, some brown sugar, and a little\ncorrosive sublimate; the sugar keeping it flexible when dry, and the\nsublimate preventing it from fermenting, and from being attacked by\ninsects. After it is made, a few drops of any of the essential oils are\nadded. Paste made in this way dries when exposed to the air, and may be\nused merely by wetting it. If required to be kept always ready for use,\nit ought to be put into covered pots. Seeds may also be <a></a>preserved by\nthe essential oils; and this is of great consequence, when they are to\nbe sent to a distance. Of course moisture must be excluded as much as\npossible, as the oils or ottos prevent only the bad effects of mould.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"FUSEL_OIL\"></a>FUSEL OIL.</h3><h4>BY W. BASTICK.</h4><p>This organic compound was first discovered by Scheele, as one of the\ndistillation products of the wort obtained from the fermentation of\npotatoes. It has been subsequently examined by Pelletier, Dumas,\nCahours, and others. It is generally now termed the hydrate of the oxide\nof amyl, from amyl being supposed to be its base or radical, as cyanogen\nis regarded to be the radical of another series of compounds.</p><p>It passes over towards the termination of the distillation process in a\nwhite turbid fluid, which consists of a watery and alcoholic solution of\nthe fusel oil. The crude oil, consisting of about one-half of its weight\nof alcohol and water, may be purified, being shaken with water and\nredistilled, with the previous addition of chloride of calcium. When the\ntemperature of the contents of retort reaches 296° Fahr., pure fusel oil\ndistils over.</p><p>Fusel oil is a colorless oily fluid, which possesses at first not an\nunagreeable odor, but at last is very disgusting, producing oppression\nat the chest and exciting cough. It has a sharp hot taste, and burns\nwith a white blue flame. It boils at 296° Fahr., and at temperature of\n-4° Fahr. it becomes solid, and forms crystals. Its specific gravity at<a></a>\n59° Fahr. is 0.8124, and its formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. On paper it\nproduces a greasy stain, which disappears by heat, and when exposed to\nthe action of the air it acquires an acid reaction. Fusel oil is\nslightly soluble in water, to which it imparts its odor; and soluble in\nall proportions in alcohol, ether, volatile and fixed oils, and acetic\nacid. It dissolves phosphorus, sulphur, and iodine without any\nnoticeable change, and also mixes with caustic soda and potash. It\nrapidly absorbs hydrochloric acid, with the disengagement of heat. When\nmixed with concentrated sulphuric acid, the mixture becomes of a\nviolet-red color, and bisulphate of amyloxide is formed. Nitric acid and\nchlorine decompose it. By its distillation with anhydrous phosphoric\nacid, a fluid, oily combination of hydrogen and carbon results. By\noxidation with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid, fusel oil yields\nvalerianic acid, which is used in medicine, and apple-oil, employed as a\nflavoring ingredient in confectionery.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"ESSENCE_OF_PINE-APPLE\"></a>ESSENCE OF PINE-APPLE.</h3><h4>BY W. BASTICK.</h4><p>The above essence is, as already known, butyric ether more or less\ndiluted with alcohol; to obtain which pure, on the large scale and\neconomically, the following process is recommended:—</p><p>Dissolve 6 lbs. of sugar and half an ounce of tartaric acid, in 26 lbs.\nof boiling water. Let the solution stand for several days; then add 8\nounces of putrid cheese broken up with 3 lbs. of skimmed and curdled\nsour milk and 3 lbs. of levigated chalk. The mixture should be kept and\nstirred <a></a>daily in a warm place, at the temperature of about 92° Fahr.,\nas long as gas is evolved, which is generally the case for five or six\nweeks.</p><p>The liquid thus obtained, is mixed with an equal volume of cold water,\nand 8 lbs. of crystallized carbonate of soda, previously dissolved in\nwater, added. It is then filtered from the precipitated carbonate of\nlime; the filtrate is to be evaporated down to 10 lbs., when 5-1/2 lbs.\nof sulphuric acid, previously diluted with an equal weight of water, are\nto be carefully added. The butyric acid, which separates on the surface\nof the liquid as a dark-colored oil, is to be removed, and the rest of\nthe liquid distilled; the distillate is now neutralized with carbonate\nof soda, and the butyric acid separated as before, with sulphuric acid.</p><p>The whole of the crude acid is to be rectified with the addition of an\nounce of sulphuric acid to every pound. The distillate is then saturated\nwith fused chloride of calcium, and redistilled. The product will be\nabout 28 ounces of pure butyric acid. To prepare the butyric acid or\nessence of pine-apple, from this acid proceed as follows:—Mix, by\nweight, three parts of butyric acid with six parts of alcohol, and two\nparts of sulphuric acid in a retort, and submit the whole, with a\nsufficient heat, to a gentle distillation, until the fluid which passes\nover ceases to emit a fruity odor. By treating the distillate with\nchloride of calcium, and by its redistillation, the pure ether may be\nobtained.</p><p>The boiling-point of butyric ether is 238° Fahr. Its specific gravity,\n0.904, and its formula,</p><p>\nC<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, or C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O + C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.<br>\n</p><p>Bensch's process, above described, for the production of butyric acid,\naffords a remarkable exemplification of the extraordinary\ntransformations that organic bodies undergo in contact with ferment, or\nby catalytic action. When cane <a></a>sugar is treated with tartaric acid,\nespecially under the influence of heat, it is converted into grape\nsugar. This grape sugar, in the presence of decomposing nitrogenous\nsubstances, such as cheese, is transformed in the first instance into\nlactic acid, which combines with the lime of the chalk. The acid of the\nlactate of lime, thus produced, is by the further influence of the\nferment changed into butyric acid. Hence, butyrate of lime is the final\nresult of the catalytic action in the process we have here recommended.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"PREPARATION_OF_CRUDE_PELARGONATE\"></a>PREPARATION OF CRUDE PELARGONATE OF ETHYL-OXIDE (ESSENCE OF QUINCE.)</h3><h4>BY DR. R. WAGNER.</h4><p>It has been believed, until the most recent period, that the peel of\nquinces contains œnanthylate of ethyl-oxide. New researches, however,\nhave led to the supposition that the odorous principle of quinces is\nderived from the ether of pelargonic acid. In my last research on the\naction of nitric acid on oil of rue, I found that besides the fatty\nacids, which Gerhardt had already discovered, pelargonic acid is formed.\nThis process may be advantageously employed for the preparation of crude\npelargonate of ethyl-oxide, which, on account of its extremely agreeable\nodor, may be applied as a fruit essence equally with those prepared by\nDobereiner, Hofmann, and Fehling. For the preparation of the liquid,\nwhich can be named the essence of quince, oil of rue is treated with\ndouble its quantity of very diluted nitric acid, and the mixture heated\nuntil it begins to boil. After some time two layers are to be observed\nin the liquid: the upper <a></a>one is brownish, and the lower one consists of\nthe products of the oxidation of oil of rue and the excess of nitric\nacid. The lower layer is freed from the greater part of its nitric acid\nby evaporation in a chloride of zinc bath. The white flocks frequently\nfound in the acid liquid, which are probably fatty acids, are separated\nby filtration. The filtrate is mixed with spirit, and long digested in a\ngentle heat, by which a fluid is formed, which has the agreeable odor of\nquince in the highest degree, and may be purified by distillation. The\nspirituous solution of pelargonic ether may also be profitably prepared\nfrom oleic acid, according to Gottlieb's method.—<i>Journal für\nPraktische Chemie.</i></p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"PREPARATION_OF_RUM-ETHER\"></a>PREPARATION OF RUM-ETHER.</h3><p>Take of black oxide of manganese, of sulphuric acid, each twelve pounds;\nof alcohol, twenty-six pounds; of strong acetic acid, ten pounds.

For the preparation of this ether, pure butyric\nacid must be first obtained by the fermentation of sugar, according to\nthe method of Bensch.<a></a> One pound of this acid is dissolved in one pound\nof strong alcohol, and mixed with from a quarter to half an ounce of\nsulphuric acid; the mixture is heated for some minutes, whereby the\nbutyric ether separates as a light stratum. The whole is mixed with half\nits volume of water, and the upper stratum then removed; the heavy fluid\nis distilled, by which more butyric ether is obtained. The distillate\nand the removed oily liquid are shaken with a little water, the lighter\nportion of the liquid removed, which at last, by being shaken with water\nand a little soda, is freed from adhering acid.</p><p>For the preparation of the essence of pine-apple, one pound of this\nether is dissolved in 8 or 10 pounds of alcohol. 20 or 25 drops of this\nsolution is sufficient to give to one pound of sugar a strong taste of\npine-apple, if a little citric or tartaric acid has been added.</p><p><i>Pear-oil.</i>—This is an alcoholic solution of acetate of amyloxide, and\nacetate of ethyloxide. For its preparation, one pound of glacial acetic\nacid is added to an equal weight of fusel-oil (which has been prepared\nby being washed with soda and water, and then distilled at a temperature\nbetween 254° and 284° Fahr.), and mixed with half a pound of sulphuric\nacid. The mixture is digested for some hours at a temperature of 254°,\nby which means acetate of amyloxide separates, particularly on the\naddition of some water. The crude acetate of amyloxide obtained by\nseparation, and by the distillation of the liquid to which the water has\nbeen added, is finally purified by being washed with soda and water.\nFifteen parts of acetate of amyloxide are dissolved with half a part of\nacetic ether in 100 or 120 parts of alcohol; this is the essence of\npear, which, when employed to flavor sugar or syrup, to which a little\ncitric or tartaric acid has been added, affords the flavor of bergamot\npears, and a fruity, refreshing taste.</p><p><a></a><i>Apple-oil</i> is an alcoholic solution of valerianate of amyloxide. It is\nobtained impure, as a by product, when for the preparation of valerianic\nacid, fusel-oil is distilled with bichromate of potash and sulphuric\nacid. It is better prepared in the following manner:—For the\npreparation of valerianic acid, 1 part of fusel-oil is mixed gradually\nwith 3 parts of sulphuric acid, and 2 parts of water added. A solution\nof 2-1/4 parts of bichromate of potash, with 4-1/2 parts of water, is\nheated in a tubulated retort, and into this fluid the former mixture is\ngradually poured, so that the ebullition is not too rapid. The\ndistillate is saturated with carbonate of soda, and warmed, when a\nsolution of 3 parts of crystallized carbonate of soda, 2 parts of strong\nsulphuric acid, diluted with an equal quantity of water, are added. The\nvalerianic acid separates as an oily stratum.</p><p>One part, by weight, of pure fusel-oil is carefully mixed with an equal\nweight of sulphuric acid. The cold solution is added to 1-1/4 parts of\nthe above valerianic acid; the mixture is warmed for some minutes (not\ntoo long or too much) in a water-bath, and then mixed with a little\nwater, by which means the impure valerianate of amyloxide separates,\nwhich is washed with water and carbonate of soda. For use as an essence\nof apples, one part of this valerianate of amyloxide is dissolved in 6\nor 8 parts of alcohol.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"VOLATILE_OIL_OF_GAULTHERIA\"></a>VOLATILE OIL OF GAULTHERIA PROCUMBENS.</h3><h4>BY W. BASTICK.</h4><p>The chemical history of this oil is one of great importance and\ninterest, affording, as it does, one of the examples <a></a>where the progress\nof modern chemistry has succeeded in producing artificially a complex\norganic body, previously only known as the result of vital force.</p><p>This volatile oil is obtained from the winter-green, an American shrub\nof the heath family, by distillation. When this plant is distilled, at\nfirst an oil passes over which consists of C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, but when the\ntemperature reaches 464° Fahr., a pure oil distils into the receiver.\nTherefore the essential oil of this plant, like many others, consists of\ntwo portions—one a hydro-carbon, and the other an oxygenated compound;\nthis latter is the chief constituent of the oil, and that which is of so\nmuch chemical interest, from the fact that it has been artificially\nprepared.</p><p>It is termed, when thus prepared, the spiroylate of the oxide of methyl,\nand is obtained when two parts of wood spirit, one and a half parts of\nspiroylic acid, and one part of sulphuric acid are distilled together.\nIt is a colorless liquid, of an agreeable aromatic odor and taste; it\ndissolves slightly in water, but in all proportions in ether and\nalcohol; it boils between 411° and 435° Fahr., and has a specific\ngravity of 1.173. This compound expels carbonic acid from its\ncombinations, and forms a series of salts, which contain one atom of\nbase and one atom of spiroylate of the oxide of methyl. It behaves\ntherefore as a conjugate acid. Its formula is C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>5</sub> +\nC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O.</p><p>The spiroylic acid may be separated from the natural oil by treating it\nwith a concentrated solution of caustic potash at a temperature of 113°\nFahr., when wood spirit is formed and evaporates, and the solution\ncontains the spiroylate of potash, from which, when decomposed with\nsulphuric acid, the spiroylic acid separates and subsides in the fluid.</p><p>Spiroylic acid is also formed by the oxidation of spiroyligenic acid,\nand when saligenin, salicin, courmacin, or indigo, is heated with\ncaustic potash.</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"ON_THE_APPLICATION_OF_ORGANIC\"></a>ON THE APPLICATION OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY TO PERFUMERY.</h3><h4>BY DR. A.W. HOFMANN,</h4><p><i>Professor to the Royal College of Chemistry, London</i>.</p><p>Cahours' excellent researches concerning the essential oil of\n<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i> (a North American plant of the natural order of\nthe Ericinæ of Jussieu), which admits of so many applications in\nperfumery,<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_I_9\">[I]</a> have opened a new field in this branch of industry. The\nintroduction of this oil among compound ethers must necessarily direct\nthe attention of perfumers<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_J_10\">[J]</a> towards this important branch of\ncompounds, the number of which is daily increasing by the labors of\nthose who apply themselves to organic chemistry. The striking similarity\nof the smell of these ethers to that of fruit had not escaped the\nobservation of chemistry; however, it was reserved to practical men to\ndiscover by which choice and combinations it might be possible to\nimitate the scent of peculiar fruits to such a nicety, that makes it\nprobable that the scent of the fruit is owing to a natural combination\nidentical to that produced by art; so much so, as to enable the chemist\nto produce from fruits the said combinations, provided he could have at\nhis disposal a sufficient quantity to operate upon. The manufacture of\nartificial aromatic oils for the purpose of perfumery<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_K_11\">[K]</a> is, of course,\na recent branch of industry; nevertheless, it has already fallen into\nthe hands of several distillers, who produce sufficient quantity to\nsupply the trade; a fact, which has <a></a>not escaped the observation of the\nJury at the London Exhibition. In visiting the stalls of English and\nFrench perfumers at the Crystal Palace, we found a great variety of\nthese chemical perfumes, the applications of which were at the same time\npractically illustrated by confectionery flavored by them. However, as\nmost of the samples of the oils sent to the Exhibition were but small, I\nwas prevented, in many cases, from making an accurate analysis of them.\nThe largest samples were those of a compound labelled \"pear-oil,\" which,\nby analysis, I discovered to be an alcoholic solution of pure acetate of\namyloxide. Not having sufficient quantity to purify it for combustion, I\ndissolved it with potash, by which free fusel-oil was separated, and\ndetermined the acetic acid in the form of a silver salt.</p><p>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 1em;\">0.3080 gram. of silver salt = 0.1997 gram. of silver.</span><br>\n</p><p>The per centage of silver in acetate of silver is, according to</p><p>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 1em;\">Theory,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 64.68</span><br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 1em;\">Experiment,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 64.55</span><br>\n</p><p>The acetate of amyloxide, which, according to the usual way of preparing\nit, represents one part sulphuric acid, one part fusel-oil, and two\nparts of acetate of potash, had a striking smell of fruit, but it\nacquired the pleasant flavor of the jargonelle pear only after having\nbeen diluted with six times its volume of spirit of wine.</p><p>Upon further inquiry I learned that considerable quantities of this oil\nare manufactured by some distillers,—from fifteen to twenty pounds\nweekly,—and sold to confectioners, who employ it chiefly in flavoring\npear-drops, which are nothing else but barley-sugar, flavored with this\noil.</p><p>I found, besides the pear-oil, also an <i>apple-oil</i>, which, according to\nmy analysis, is nothing but valerianate of amyloxide. Every one must\nrecollect the insupportable smell <a></a>of rotten apples which fills the\nlaboratory whilst making valerianic acid. By operating upon this raw\ndistillate produced with diluted potash, valerianic acid is removed, and\nan ether remains behind, which, diluted in five or six times its volume\nof spirits of wine, is possessed of the most pleasant flavor of apples.</p><p>The essential oil<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_L_12\">[L]</a> most abundant in the Exhibition was the pine-apple\noil, which, as you well know, is nothing else but the butyrate of\nethyloxide. Even in this combination, like in the former, the pleasant\nflavor or scent is only attained by diluting the ether with alcohol. The\nbutyric ether which is employed in Germany to flavor bad rum, is\nemployed in England to flavor an acidulated drink called pine-apple ale.\nFor this purpose they generally do not employ pure butyric acid, but a\nproduct obtained by saponification of butter, and subsequent\ndistillation of the soap with concentrated sulphuric acid and alcohol;\nwhich product contains, besides the butyric ether, other ethers, but\nnevertheless can be used for flavoring spirits. The sample I analyzed\nwas purer, and appeared to have been made with pure butyric ether.</p><p>Decomposed with potash and changed into silver salt, it gave</p><p>\n0.4404 gram. of silver salt = 0.2437 gram. of silver.<br>\n</p><p>The per centage of silver in the butyrate of silver is according to</p><p>\nTheory,      55.38<br>\nExperiment,  55.33<br>\n</p><p>Both English and French exhibitors have also sent samples of cognac-oil\nand grape-oil, which are employed to flavor the common sorts of brandy.\nAs these samples were <a></a>very small, I was prevented from making an\naccurate analysis. However, I am certain that the grape-oil is a\ncombination of amyl, diluted with much alcohol; since, when acted upon\nwith concentrated sulphuric acid, and the oil freed from alcohol by\nwashing it with water, it gave amylsulphuric acid, which was identified\nby the analysis of the salt of barytes.</p><p>1.2690 gram. of amylsulphate of barytes gave 0.5825 gram. of sulphate of\nbarytes. This corresponds to 45.82 per cent. of sulphate of barytes.</p><p>Amylsulphate of barytes, crystallized with two equivalents of water,\ncontains, according to the analysis of Cahours and Kekule, 45.95 per\ncent. of sulphate of barytes. It is curious to find here a body, which,\non account of its noxious smell, is removed with great care from\nspirituous liquors, to be applied under a different form for the purpose\nof imparting to them a pleasant flavor.</p><p>I must needs here also mention the artificial oil of bitter almonds.\nWhen Mitscherlich, in the year 1834, discovered the nitrobenzol, he\nwould not have dreamed that this product would be manufactured for the\npurpose of perfumery, and, after twenty years, appear in fine labelled\nsamples at the London Exhibition. It is true that, even at the time of\nthe discovery of nitrobenzol, he pointed out the striking similarity of\nits smell to that of the oil of bitter almonds. However, at that time,\nthe only known sources for obtaining this body were the compressed gases\nand the distillation of benzoic acid, consequently the enormity of its\nprice banished any idea of employing benzol as a substitute for oil of\nbitter almonds. However, in the year 1845, I succeeded by means of the\nanilin-reaction in ascertaining the existence of benzol in common\ncoal-tar oil; and, in the year 1849, C.B. Mansfield proved, by careful\nexperiments, that <a></a>benzol can be won without difficulty in great\nquantity from coal-tar oil. In his essay, which contains many\ninteresting details about the practical use of benzol, he speaks\nlikewise of the possibility of soon obtaining the sweet-scented\nnitrobenzol in great quantity. The Exhibition has proved that his\nobservation has not been left unnoticed by the perfumers. Among French\nperfumeries we have found, under the name of artificial oil of bitter\nalmonds, and under the still more poetical name of \"essence de mirbane,\"\nseveral samples of essential oils, which are no more nor less than\nnitrobenzol. I was not able to obtain accurate details about the extent\nof this branch of manufacture, which seems to be of some importance. In\nLondon, this article is manufactured with success. The apparatus\nemployed is that of Mansfield, which is very simple. It consists of a\nlarge glass worm, the upper extremity of which divides in two branches\nor tubes, which are provided with funnels. Through one of these funnels\npasses a stream of concentrated nitric acid; the other is destined as a\nreceiver of benzol, which, for this purpose, requires not to be quite\npure; at the angle from where the two tubes branch out, the two bodies\nmeet together, and instantly the chemical combination takes place, which\ncools sufficiently by passing through the glass worm. The product is\nafterwards washed with water, and some diluted solution of carbonate of\nsoda; it is then ready for use. Notwithstanding the great physical\nsimilarity between nitrobenzol and oil of bitter almonds, there is yet a\nslight <i>difference in smell which can be detected by an experienced\nnose</i>.<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_M_13\">[M]</a> However, nitrobenzol is very useful in scenting soap, and\nmight be employed with great advantage by confectioners and cooks,\nparticularly on account of its safety, being entirely free from prussic\nacid.</p><p><a></a>There were, besides the above, several other artificial oils; they all,\nhowever, were more or less complicated, and in so small quantities, that\nit was impossible to ascertain their exact nature, and it was doubtful\nwhether they had the same origin as the former.</p><p>The application of organic chemistry to perfumery is quite new; it is\nprobable that the study of all the ethers or ethereal combinations\nalready known, and of those which the ingenuity of the chemist is daily\ndiscovering, will enlarge the sphere of their practical applications.\nThe capryl-ethers lately discovered by Bouis are remarkable for their\naromatic smells (the acetate of capryloxide is possessed of the most\nintense and pleasant smell), and they promise a large harvest to the\nmanufacturers of perfumes.—<i>Annalen der Chemie.</i></p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"CORRESPONDENCE_FROM_THE\"></a>CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE \"JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS.\"<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_N_14\">[N]</a></h3><h4><span class=\"smcap\">Chemistry and Perfumery</span>.</h4><p><span class=\"smcap\">Sir,</span></p><p>When such periodicals as \"Household Words\" and the \"Family Herald\"\ncontain scientific matters, treated in a manner to popularize science,\nall real lovers of philosophy must feel gratified; a little fiction, a\nlittle metaphor, is expected, and is accepted with the good intention\nwith which it is given, in such popular prints; but when the \"Journal of\nthe Society of Arts\" reprints quotations from such sources, without\nmodifying or correcting their expressions, it conveys <a></a>to its readers a\ntissue of fiction rather too flimsy to bear a truthful analysis.<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_O_15\">[O]</a></p><p>In the article on Chemistry and Perfumery, in No. 47, you quote that\n\"some of the most delicate perfumes are now made by chemical artifice,\nand not, as of old, by distilling them from flowers.\" Now, sir, this\nstatement conveys to the public a very erroneous idea; because the\nsubstances afterwards spoken of are named essences of fruit, and not\nessences of flowers, and the essences of fruits named in your article\nnever are, and never can be, used in perfumery.

Our own flower-farms at Mitcham, in Surrey, need not\nbe mentioned in comparison, although important. These, sir, are the main\nsources of <a></a>perfumes.

Some of the largest wholesale perfumers use\nfive or six pounds of gum benzoin per annum, but none use the benzoic\nacid.

I need scarcely say,\n<a></a>that it is the benzoic acid of the urine which is the odoriferous\nprinciple.</p><div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\">Your obedient servant,<br></span>\n<span class=\"i4\"><span class=\"smcap\">A Perfumer.</span><br></span>\n</div></div><p>[When benzoic acid is prepared by any of the wet processes, it is <i>free\nfrom the fragrant volatile oil</i> which accompanies it when prepared by\nsublimation from the resin, and to which oil the acid of commerce owes\nits peculiar odor. This fact completely nullifies the above\nassertion.—<span class=\"smcap\">Septimus Piesse.</span>]</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Chemistry and Perfumery.</span><a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_Q_17\">[Q]</a></p><p>Sir,</p><p>If the author of the Letter on Chemistry and Perfumery, published in No.\n50 of your Journal, and intended as a reply to mine—though none was\nneeded—which appeared in No. 49, really be a perfumer, as his signature\nimplies, he would know that I could not, though ever so inclined,\n\"confine the term perfumery\" to various odoriferous substances, and\nexclude scented soaps; because he would be aware that one-third of the\nreturns of every manufacturing perfumer is derived from perfumed soap. I\ndo however emphatically exclude from the term perfumery, \"groceries,\n&amp;c.,\" the <i>et cætera</i> meaning, I presume, \"confectionery,\" because\nperfumery has to do with one of the senses, <span class=\"smcap\">smelling</span>, while\ngroceries, &amp;c., are distinguishable by another, <span class=\"smcap\">taste</span>; and had\nnot our physical faculties clearly made the distinction, commerce and\nmanufactures would have defined them: I therefore repeat, that the\nartificial essences of fruits are not used in perfumery, as stated in\nNo. 47, from the quoted authorities. If any man can deny this assertion,\nlet him now do so, \"or forever after hold his peace,\" at <a></a>least upon\nthis subject. The \"Journal of the Society of Arts\" is not a medium of\nmere controversy. If a statement be made in error, let truth correct it,\nwhich, if gain-sayed, it should be done, not under the veil of an\nanonymous correspondent, but with a name to support the assertion.\nScience has to deal with tangible facts and figures, to the political\nalone belongs the anonymous ink-spiller.</p><div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\">I am, sir, yours

<i>flavor</i> had been used by the various authors who have\nwritten upon this subject, in place of the word <i>perfume</i>, the\ndissemination of an erroneous idea would have been prevented: the word\nperfume, applied to pear-oil, pine-apple oil, &amp;c., implies, and the\ngeneral tenor of the remarks of the writers leads the reader to infer,\nthat these substances are used by perfumers, who not only do not, but\ncannot use them in their trade.</p><p>But for <i>flavoring</i> nectar, lozenges, sweetmeats, &amp;c., these ethers, or\noils as the writers term them, are extensively used, and quite in\naccordance with assertions of Hoffman, Playfair, Fehling, and Bastick.\nHowever, the glorious achievements of modern chemistry have not lost\nanything by this misapplication of a trade term.—<span class=\"smcap\">Septimus\nPiesse.</span>]</p><hr style=\"width: 45%;\"><h3><a id=\"OTTOS_FROM_PLANTS\"></a>OTTOS FROM PLANTS.</h3><h4> <span class=\"smcap\">Quantities of Ottos, otherwise
