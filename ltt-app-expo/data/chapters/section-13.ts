The kohhl is applied with a small\nprobe of wood, ivory, or silver, tapering towards the end, but blunt.\nThis is moistened sometimes with rose-water, then dipped in the powder,\nand drawn along the edges of the eyelids. It is thought to give a very\nsoft expression to the eye, the size of which, in appearance, it\nenlarges; to which circumstances probably Jeremiah refers when he\nwrites, \"Though thou rentest thy face (or thine eyes) with painting, in\nvain shalt thou make thyself fair.\"—<i>Jer.</i> 4:30. See also\n<span class=\"smcap\">Lane's</span> <i>Modern Egyptians</i>, vol. i, p. 41, et seq.</p><p>A singular custom is observable both among Moorish and Arab\nfemales—that of ornamenting the face between the eyes with clusters of\nbluish spots or other small devices, and which, being stained, become\npermanent. The chin is also spotted in a similar manner, and a narrow\nblue line extends from <a></a>the point of it, and is continued down the\nthroat. The eyelashes, eyebrows, and also the tips and extremities of\nthe eyelids, are colored black. The soles, and sometimes other parts of\nthe feet, as high as the ankles, the palms of the hands, and the nails,\nare dyed with a yellowish-red, with the leaves of a plant called Henna\n(<i>Lawsonia inermis</i>), the leaf of which somewhat resembles the myrtle,\nand is dried for the purposes above mentioned. The back of the hand is\nalso often colored and ornamented in this way with different devices. On\nholidays they paint their cheeks of a red brick color, a narrow red line\nbeing also drawn down the temples.</p><p>In Greece, \"for coloring the lashes and sockets of the eye they throw\nincense or gum labdanum on some coals of fire, intercept the smoke which\nascends with a plate, and collect the soot. This I saw applied. A girl,\nsitting cross-legged as usual on a sofa, and closing one of her eyes,\ntook the two lashes between the forefinger and thumb of her left hand,\npulled them forward, and then, thrusting in at the external corner a\nsort of bodkin or probe which had been immersed in the soot, and\nwithdrawing it, the particles previously adhering to the probe remained\nwithin the eyelashes.\"—<span class=\"smcap\">Chandler's</span> <i>Travels in Greece.</i></p><p>Dr. Shaw states that among other curiosities that were taken out of the\ntombs at Sahara relating to Egyptian women, he saw a joint of the common\nreeds, which contained one of these bodkins and an ounce or more of this\npowder.</p><p>In England the same practice is adopted by many <a></a>persons that have gray\nhair; but instead of using the black material in the form of a powder,\nit is employed as a crayon, the color being mixed with a greasy body,\nsuch as the brown and black stick pomatums, described in the previous\narticle.</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\">Turkish Hair Dye</span>.</h4><p>In Constantinople there are some persons, particularly Armenians, who\ndevote themselves to the preparation of cosmetics, and obtain large sums\nof money from those desirous of learning this art. Amongst these\ncosmetics is a black dye for the hair, which, according to Landerer, is\nprepared in the following manner:—</p><p>Finely pulverized galls are kneaded with a little oil to a paste, which\nis roasted in an iron pan until the oil vapors cease to evolve, upon\nwhich the residue is triturated with water into a paste, and heated\nagain to dryness. At the same time a metallic mixture, which is brought\nfrom Egypt to the commercial marts of the East, and which is termed in\nTurkish <i>Rastiko-petra</i>, or <i>Rastik-Yuzi</i>, is employed for this purpose.\nThis metal, which looks like dross, is by some Armenians intentionally\nfused, and consists of iron and copper. It obtains its name from its use\nfor the coloration of the hair, and particularly the eyebrows—for\n<i>rastik</i> means eyebrows, and <i>yuzi</i> stone. The fine powder of this metal\nis as intimately mixed as possible with the moistened gall-mass into a\npaste, which is preserved in a damp place, by which it acquires the\nblackening property. In some cases this <a></a>mass is mixed with, the powder\nof odorous substances which are used in the seraglio as perfumes, and\ncalled <i>harsi</i>, that is, pleasant odor; and of these the principal\ningredient is ambergris. To blacken the hair a little of this dye is\ntriturated in the hand or between the fingers, with which the hair or\nbeard is well rubbed. After a few days the hair becomes very beautifully\nblack, and it is a real pleasure to see such fine black beards as are\nmet with in the East among the Turks who use this black dye. Another and\nimportant advantage in the use of this dye consists therein, that the\nhair remains soft, pliant, and for a long time black, when it has been\nonce dyed with this substance. That the coloring properties of this dye\nare to be chiefly ascribed to the pyrogallic acid, which can be found by\ntreating the mass with water, may be with certainty assumed.</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\">Litharge Hair Dye</span>.</h4><div class=\"center\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Powdered litharge,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 lbs.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Quicklime,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2 lb.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Calcined magnesia,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2 lb.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table></div><p>Slake the lime, using as little water as possible to make it\ndisintegrate, then mix the whole by a sieve.</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\">Another Way</span>.</h4><div class=\"center\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Slaked lime,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 lbs.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">White lead in powder,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 lbs.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Litharge,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 lb.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table></div><p>Mix by sifting, bottle, and well cork.</p><p><i>Directions</i> to be sold with the above.—\"Mix the <a></a>powder with enough\nwater to form a thick creamy fluid; with the aid of a small brush;\ncompletely cover the hair to be dyed with this mixture; to dye a light\nbrown, allow it to remain on the hair four hours; dark brown, eight\nhours; black, twelve hours.

Care must\nbe taken not to wet the skin unnecessarily with it.</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\">Quick Depilatory or Rusma</span>. (<i>For removing hair.</i>)</h4><p>As the ladies of this country consider the growth of hair upon the upper\nlip, upon the arms, and on the back of the neck, to be detrimental to\nbeauty, those who are troubled with such physical indications of good\nhealth and vital stamina have long had recourse to rusma or depilatory\nfor removing it.</p><p>This or analogous preparations were introduced into this country from\nthe East, rusma having been in use in the harems of Asia for many ages.</p><div class=\"center\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Best lime slaked,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 lb.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Orpiment, in powder,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2 lbs.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table></div><p>Mix the material by means of a drum sieve; preserve <a></a>the same for sale\nin well-corked or stoppered bottles.</p><p><i>Directions</i> to be sold with the above. Mix the depilatory powder with\nenough water to render it of a creamy consistency; lay it upon the hair\nfor about five minutes, or until its caustic action upon the skin\nrenders it necessary to be removed; a similar process to shaving is then\nto be gone through, but instead of using a razor, operate with an ivory\nor bone paper-knife; then wash the part with plenty of water, and apply\na little cold cream.</p><p>The precise time to leave depilatory upon the part to be depilated\ncannot be given, because there is a physical difference in the nature of\nhair. \"Raven tresses\" require more time than \"flaxen locks;\" the\nsensitiveness of the skin has also to be considered. A small feather is\na very good test for its action.</p><p>A few readers will, perhaps, be disappointed in finding that I have only\ngiven one formula for depilatory. The receipts might easily have been\nincreased in number, but not in quality. The use of arsenical compounds\nis objectionable, but it undoubtedly increases the depilating action of\nthe compounds. A few compilers of \"Receipt Books,\" \"Supplements to\nPharmacopœias,\" and others, add to the lime \"charcoal powder,\"\n\"carbonate of potass,\" \"starch,\" &amp;c.; but what action have these\nmaterials—chemically—upon hair? The simplest depilatory is moistened\nquicklime, but it is less energetic than the mixture recommended above;\nit answers very well for tanners and fellmongers, with whom time is no\nobject.</p><hr style=\"width: 65%;\">"
