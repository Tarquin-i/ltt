than that of painting the face, dyeing the hair, and blackening the
eyebrows and eyelashes.</p><p>It is a practice universal among the women of the higher and middle
classes in Egypt, and very common among those of the lower orders, to
blacken the edge of the eyelids, both above and below the eye, with a
black powder, which they term <i>kohhl</i>. The kohhl is applied with a small
probe of wood, ivory, or silver, tapering towards the end, but blunt.
This is moistened sometimes with rose-water, then dipped in the powder,
and drawn along the edges of the eyelids. It is thought to give a very
soft expression to the eye, the size of which, in appearance, it
enlarges; to which circumstances probably Jeremiah refers when he
writes, "Though thou rentest thy face (or thine eyes) with painting, in
vain shalt thou make thyself fair."—<i>Jer.</i> 4:30. See also
<span class="smcap">Lane's</span> <i>Modern Egyptians</i>, vol. i, p. 41, et seq.</p><p>A singular custom is observable both among Moorish and Arab
females—that of ornamenting the face between the eyes with clusters of
bluish spots or other small devices, and which, being stained, become
permanent. The chin is also spotted in a similar manner, and a narrow
blue line extends from <a id="Page_223"></a>the point of it, and is continued down the
throat. The eyelashes, eyebrows, and also the tips and extremities of
the eyelids, are colored black. The soles, and sometimes other parts of
the feet, as high as the ankles, the palms of the hands, and the nails,
are dyed with a yellowish-red, with the leaves of a plant called Henna
(<i>Lawsonia inermis</i>), the leaf of which somewhat resembles the myrtle,
and is dried for the purposes above mentioned. The back of the hand is
also often colored and ornamented in this way with different devices. On
holidays they paint their cheeks of a red brick color, a narrow red line
being also drawn down the temples.</p><p>In Greece, "for coloring the lashes and sockets of the eye they throw
incense or gum labdanum on some coals of fire, intercept the smoke which
ascends with a plate, and collect the soot. This I saw applied. A girl,
sitting cross-legged as usual on a sofa, and closing one of her eyes,
took the two lashes between the forefinger and thumb of her left hand,
pulled them forward, and then, thrusting in at the external corner a
sort of bodkin or probe which had been immersed in the soot, and
withdrawing it, the particles previously adhering to the probe remained
within the eyelashes."—<span class="smcap">Chandler's</span> <i>Travels in Greece.</i></p><p>Dr. Shaw states that among other curiosities that were taken out of the
tombs at Sahara relating to Egyptian women, he saw a joint of the common
reeds, which contained one of these bodkins and an ounce or more of this
powder.</p><p>In England the same practice is adopted by many <a id="Page_224"></a>persons that have gray
hair; but instead of using the black material in the form of a powder,
it is employed as a crayon, the color being mixed with a greasy body,
such as the brown and black stick pomatums, described in the previous
article.</p><h4><span class="smcap">Turkish Hair Dye</span>.</h4><p>In Constantinople there are some persons, particularly Armenians, who
devote themselves to the preparation of cosmetics, and obtain large sums
of money from those desirous of learning this art. Amongst these
cosmetics is a black dye for the hair, which, according to Landerer, is
prepared in the following manner:—</p><p>Finely pulverized galls are kneaded with a little oil to a paste, which
is roasted in an iron pan until the oil vapors cease to evolve, upon
which the residue is triturated with water into a paste, and heated
again to dryness. At the same time a metallic mixture, which is brought
from Egypt to the commercial marts of the East, and which is termed in
Turkish <i>Rastiko-petra</i>, or <i>Rastik-Yuzi</i>, is employed for this purpose.
This metal, which looks like dross, is by some Armenians intentionally
fused, and consists of iron and copper. It obtains its name from its use
for the coloration of the hair, and particularly the eyebrows—for
<i>rastik</i> means eyebrows, and <i>yuzi</i> stone. The fine powder of this metal
is as intimately mixed as possible with the moistened gall-mass into a
paste, which is preserved in a damp place, by which it acquires the
blackening property. In some cases this <a id="Page_225"></a>mass is mixed with, the powder
of odorous substances which are used in the seraglio as perfumes, and
called <i>harsi</i>, that is, pleasant odor; and of these the principal
ingredient is ambergris. To blacken the hair a little of this dye is
triturated in the hand or between the fingers, with which the hair or
beard is well rubbed. After a few days the hair becomes very beautifully
black, and it is a real pleasure to see such fine black beards as are
met with in the East among the Turks who use this black dye. Another and
important advantage in the use of this dye consists therein, that the
hair remains soft, pliant, and for a long time black, when it has been
once dyed with this substance. That the coloring properties of this dye
are to be chiefly ascribed to the pyrogallic acid, which can be found by
treating the mass with water, may be with certainty assumed.</p><h4><span class="smcap">Litharge Hair Dye</span>.</h4><div class="center">

scarcely be observed that its effects are more rapidly produced by
exposing the hair to sunshine and air.</p><h4><span class="smcap">Hair Dye, with Mordant</span>. (<i>Brown.</i>)</h4><div class="center">

well preserved in closed bottles, otherwise, instead of the mordant
acting to make to make the hair black, it will tend to impart a <i>yellow</i>
hue. When the mordant is good, it has a very disagreeable odor, and
although this is the quickest and best dye, its unpleasant smell has
given rise to the</p><h4><span class="smcap">Inodorous Dye</span>.</h4><p><i>Blue bottles.</i>—Dissolve the nitrate of silver in the water as in the

ammonia in small portions until the fluid again becomes bright from the
oxide of silver being redissolved.</p><p><i>White bottles</i>.—Pour half a pint of boiling rose-water upon three
ounces of powdered gall-nuts; when cold, strain and bottle. This forms
the mordant, and is used in the same way as the first-named dye, like
the sulphuret mordant. It is not so good a dye as the previous one.</p><h4><span class="smcap">French Brown Dye</span>.</h4><p><i>Blue Bottles</i>.—Saturated solution of sulphate of copper; to this add
ammonia enough to precipitate the oxide of copper and redissolve it (as
with the silver in the above), producing the azure liquid.</p><p><a id="Page_228"></a><i>White Bottles</i>.—<i>Mordant</i>.—Saturated solution of prussiate of

be taken not to wet the skin unnecessarily with it.</p><h4><span class="smcap">Quick Depilatory or Rusma</span>. (<i>For removing hair.</i>)</h4><p>As the ladies of this country consider the growth of hair upon the upper
lip, upon the arms, and on the back of the neck, to be detrimental to
beauty, those who are troubled with such physical indications of good
health and vital stamina have long had recourse to rusma or depilatory
for removing it.</p><p>This or analogous preparations were introduced into this country from
the East, rusma having been in use in the harems of Asia for many ages.</p><div class="center">

in well-corked or stoppered bottles.</p><p><i>Directions</i> to be sold with the above. Mix the depilatory powder with
enough water to render it of a creamy consistency; lay it upon the hair
for about five minutes, or until its caustic action upon the skin
renders it necessary to be removed; a similar process to shaving is then
to be gone through, but instead of using a razor, operate with an ivory
or bone paper-knife; then wash the part with plenty of water, and apply
a little cold cream.</p><p>The precise time to leave depilatory upon the part to be depilated
cannot be given, because there is a physical difference in the nature of
hair. "Raven tresses" require more time than "flaxen locks;" the
sensitiveness of the skin has also to be considered. A small feather is
a very good test for its action.</p><p>A few readers will, perhaps, be disappointed in finding that I have only
given one formula for depilatory. The receipts might easily have been
increased in number, but not in quality. The use of arsenical compounds
is objectionable, but it undoubtedly increases the depilating action of
the compounds. A few compilers of "Receipt Books," "Supplements to
Pharmacopœias," and others, add to the lime "charcoal powder,"
"carbonate of potass," "starch," &amp;c.; but what action have these
materials—chemically—upon hair? The simplest depilatory is moistened
quicklime, but it is less energetic than the mixture recommended above;
it answers very well for tanners and fellmongers, with whom time is no
object.</p><hr style="width: 65%;">`
