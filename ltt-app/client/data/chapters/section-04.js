The western coast of\nIreland is often found to yield large pieces of this substance. The\nshores of the counties of Sligo, Mayo, Kerry, and the isles of Arran,\nare the principal <a></a>places where it has been found. In the \"Philosophical\nTransactions\" there is an account of a lump found on the beach of the\nfirst-mentioned county, in the year 1691, which weighed 52 oz., and was\nbought on the spot for 20<i>l.</i>, but which afterwards was sold in London\nfor more than 100<i>l.</i> (Philos. Trans. No. 227, p. 509). We are quite\nwithin limit in stating that many volumes concerning the origin of\nambergris have been written, but the question respecting it is still at\nissue. It is found in the stomachs of the most voracious fishes, these\nanimals swallowing, at particular times, everything they happen to meet\nwith. It has been particularly found in the intestines of the spermaceti\nwhale, and most commonly in sickly fish, whence it is supposed to be the\ncause or effect of the disease.</p><p>Some authors, and among them Robert Boyle, consider it to be of\nvegetable production, and analogous to amber; hence its name\namber-<i>gris</i> (gray) gray amber. It is not, however, within the province\nof this work to discuss upon the various theories about its production,\nwhich could probably be satisfactorily explained if our modern\nappliances were brought to bear upon the subject. The field is open to\nany scientific enthusiast; all recent authors who mention it, merely\nquoting the facts known more than a century ago.</p><p>A modern compiler, speaking of ambergris, says, \"It smells like dried\ncow-dung.\" Never having smelled this latter substance, we cannot say\nwhether the simile be correct; but we certainly consider that <a></a>its\nperfume is most incredibly overrated; nor can we forget that\n<span class=\"smcap\">Homberg</span> found that \"a vessel in which he had made a long\ndigestion of the human fæces had acquired a very strong and perfect\nsmell of ambergris, insomuch that any one would have thought that a\ngreat quantity of essence of ambergris had been made in it. The perfume\n(<i>odor!</i>) was so strong that the vessel was obliged to be moved out of\nthe laboratory.\" (Mem. Acad. Paris, 1711.)</p><p>Nevertheless, as ambergris is extensively used as a perfume, in\ndeference to those who admire its odor, we presume that it has to many\nan agreeable smell.</p><p>Like bodies of this kind undergoing a slow decomposition and possessing\nlittle volatility, it, when mixed with other very fleeting scents, gives\npermanence to them on the handkerchief, and for this quality the\nperfumer esteems it much.</p><h4> <span class=\"smcap\">Essence of Ambergris</span></h4><p>Is only kept for mixing; when retailed it has to be sweetened up to the\npublic nose; it is then called after the Parisian name</p><h4> <span class=\"smcap\">Extrait d'Ambre.</span></h4><div class=\"center\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Esprit de rose triple,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2 pint.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Extract of ambergris,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Essence of musk,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/4 \"</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Extract of vanilla,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 ounces.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table></div><p>This perfume has such a lasting odor, that a handkerchief being well\nperfumed with it, will still retain an odor even after it has been\nwashed.</p><p><a></a>The fact is, that both musk and ambergris contain a substance which\nclings pertinaciously to woven fabrics, and not being soluble in weak\nalkaline lyes, is still found upon the material after passing through\nthe lavatory ordeal.</p><p>Powdered ambergris is used in the manufacture of cassolettes—little\nivory or bone boxes perforated—which are made to contain a paste of\nstrong-smelling substances, to carry in the pocket or reticule; also in\nthe making of peau d'Espagne, or Spanish skin, used for perfuming\nwriting paper and envelopes, and which will be described hereafter.</p><p><a id=\"civet\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 448px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption14\">\n<img alt=\"Civet Cat.\" height=\"343\" src=\"/static/images/book/image113.png\" title=\"\" width=\"448\" id=\"img_images_image113.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption14\">Civet Cat.</span>\n</div><p><span class=\"smcap\">Civet</span>.—This substance is secreted by the <i>Viverra civetta</i>, or\ncivet cat. It is formed in a large double glandular receptacle between\nthe anus and the pudendum of the creature. Like many other substances of\nOriental origin, it was first brought to this country by the Dutch.</p><p>When the civet cats are kept in a state of confinement, which at one\ntime was common in Amsterdam, <a></a>they are placed in strong cages, so\nconstructed as to prevent the animal from turning round and biting the\nperson employed in collecting the secreted substance. This operation is\nsaid to be performed twice a week, and is done by scraping out the civet\nwith a small spoon: about a drachm at a time is thus obtained. A good\ndeal of the civet now brought to European markets is from Calicut,\ncapital of the province of Malabar, and from Bassora on the Euphrates.</p><p>In its pure state, civet has, to nearly all persons, a most disgusting\nodor; but when diluted to an infinitesimal portion, its perfume is\nagreeable. It is difficult to ascertain the reason why the same\nsubstance, modified only by the quantity of matter presented to the\nnose, should produce an opposite effect on the olfactory nerve; but such\nis the case with nearly all odorous bodies, especially with ottos,\nwhich, if smelled at, are far from nice, and in some cases, positively\nnasty—such as otto of neroli, otto of thyme, otto of patchouly; but if\ndiluted with a thousand times its volume of oil, spirit, &amp;c., then their\nfragrance is delightful.</p><p>Otto of rose to many has a sickly odor, but when eliminated in the\nhomeopathic quantities as it rises from a single rose-bloom, who is it\nthat will not admit that \"the rose is sweet?\" The odor of civet is best\nimparted, not by actual contact, but by being placed in the neighborhood\nof absorbent materials. Thus, when spread upon leather, which, being\ncovered with silk and placed in a writing-desk, perfumes the paper and\nenvelopes delightfully, and so much so, <a></a>that they retain the odor after\npassing through the post.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Extract of Civet</span> is prepared by rubbing in a mortar one ounce\nof civet with an ounce of orris-root powder, or any other similar\nmaterial that will assist to break up or divide the civet; and then\nplacing the whole into a gallon of rectified spirits; after macerating\nfor a month, it is fit to strain off. It is principally used as a\n\"fixing\" ingredient, in mixing essences of delicate odor. The French\nperfumers use the extract of civet more than English manufacturers, who\nseem to prefer extract of musk. From a quarter of a pint to half a pint\nis the utmost that ought to be mixed with a gallon of any other perfume.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Castor</span> is a secretion of the <i>Castor fiber</i>, or beaver, very\nsimilar to civet. Though we have often heard of its being used in\nperfumery, we do not personally know that such is the case.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Musk</span>.—This extraordinary substance, like civet, is an animal\nsecretion; it is contained in excretory follicles about the navel of the\nmale animal. In the perfumery trade these little bags are called \"pods,\"\nand as imported it is called \"pod musk.\" When the musk is separated from\nthe skin or sack in which it is contained, it is then called \"grain\nmusk.\"</p><p>The musk deer (<i>Moschus moschatus</i>) is an inhabitant of the great\nmountain range which belts the north of India, and branches out into\nSiberia, Thibet, and China. And it is also found in the Altaic range,\nnear Lake Baikal, and in some other mountain ranges, <a></a>but always on the\nborders of the line of perpetual snow. It is from the male animal only\nthat the musk is produced.</p><p><a id=\"musk\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 375px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption15\">\n<img alt=\"Musk Pod, actual size.\" height=\"376\" src=\"/static/images/book/image116.png\" title=\"\" width=\"375\" id=\"img_images_image116.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption15\">Musk Pod, actual size.</span>\n</div><p>It formerly was held in high repute as a medicine, and is still so among\nEastern nations. The musk from Boutan, Tonquin, and Thibet, is most\nesteemed, that from Bengal is inferior, and from Russia is of still\nlower quality. The strength and the quantity produced by a single animal\nvaries with the season of the year and the age of the animal. A single\nmusk pod usually contains from two to three drachms of grain musk. Musk\nis imported into England from China, in caddies of from 50 to 100 ounces\neach. When adulterated with the animal's blood, which is often the case,\nit forms into lumps or clots; it is sometimes also mixed with a dark,\nfriable earth. Those pods in which little pieces of lead are discovered,\nas a general rule, yield the finest quality of musk; upon this rule, we\npresume that the best musk <a></a>is the most worthy of adulteration. Musk is\nremarkable for the diffusiveness and subtlety of its scent; everything\nin its vicinity soon becomes affected by it, and long retains its odor,\nalthough not in actual contact with it.</p><p>It is a fashion of the present day for people to say \"that they do not\nlike musk;\" but, nevertheless, from great experience in one of the\nlargest manufacturing perfumatories in Europe, we are of opinion that\nthe public taste for musk is as great as any perfumer desires. Those\nsubstances containing it always take the preference in ready sale—so\nlong as the vendor takes care to assure his customer \"that there is no\nmusk in it.\"</p><p><a id=\"deer\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 415px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption16\">\n<img alt=\"The Musk Deer.\" height=\"336\" src=\"/static/images/book/image117.png\" title=\"\" width=\"415\" id=\"img_images_image117.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption16\">The Musk Deer.</span>\n</div><p>The perfumer uses musk principally in the scenting of soap, sachet\npowder, and in mixing for liquid perfumery. The just reputation of\nParis's original Windsor soap is due, in the main, to its delightful\nodor. The soap is, doubtless, of the finest quality, <a></a>but its perfume\nstamps it among the <i>élite</i>—its fragrance it owes to musk.</p><p>The alkaline reaction of soap is favorable to the development of the\nodoriferous principle of musk. If, however, a strong solution of potass\nbe poured on to grain musk, ammonia is developed instead of the true\nmusk smell.</p><h4> <span class=\"smcap\">Extract of Musk.</span></h4><div class=\"center\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Grain musk,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 oz.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rectified spirit,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 gallon.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table></div><p>After standing for one month, at a summer temperature, it is fit to draw\noff. Such an extract is that which is used for mixing in other perfumes.\nThat extract of musk which is prepared for retail sale, is prepared\nthus:—</p><h4> <span class=\"smcap\">Extrait de Musc.</span></h4><div class=\"center\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Extract of musk (as above),</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 pint.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambergris,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2 \"</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rose triple,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/4 \"</td></tr>\n</tbody></table></div><p>Mix and filter it; it is then fit for bottling.</p><p>This preparation is sweeter than pure extract of musk made according to\nour first formula, and is also more profitable to the vendor. It will be\nseen hereafter that the original extract of musk is principally used for\na fixing ingredient in other perfumes, to give permanence to a volatile\nodor; customers requiring, in a general way, that which is incompatible,\nnamely, that a perfume shall be strong to smell, <i>i.e.</i><a></a> very volatile,\nand that it shall remain upon the handkerchief for a long period,\n<i>ergo</i>, not volatile! Small portions of extract of musk, mixed with\nesprit de rose, violet, tuberose, and others, do, in a measure, attain\nthis object; that is, after the violet, &amp;c., has evaporated, the\nhandkerchief still retains an odor, which, although not that of the\noriginal smell, yet gives satisfaction, because it is pleasant to the\nnasal organ.</p><hr style=\"width: 65%;\">"
