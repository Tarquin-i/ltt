</div></div><p>Among the numerous gratifications derived from the cultivation of
flowers, that of rearing them for the sake of their perfumes stands
pre-eminent. It is proved from the oldest records, that perfumes have
been in use from the earliest periods. The origin of this, like that of
many other arts, is lost in the depth of its antiquity; though it had
its rise, no doubt, in religious observances. Among the nations of
antiquity, an offering of perfumes was regarded as a token of the most
profound respect and homage. Incense, or Frankincense, which exudes by
incision and <a id="Page_22"></a>dries as a gum, from <i>Arbor-thurifera</i>, was formerly burnt
in the temples of all religions, in honor of the divinities that were
there adored. Many of the primitive Christians were put to death because
they would not offer incense to idols.</p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Of the use of these luxuries by the Greeks, and afterwards by the
Romans, Pliny and Seneca gives much information respecting perfume
drugs, the method of collecting them, and the prices at which they
sold. Oils and powder perfumery were most lavishly used, for even
three times a day did some of the luxurious people anoint and
scent themselves, carrying their precious perfumes with them to
the baths in costly and elegant boxes called <span class="smcap">Narthecia</span>."</p></div><p>In the Romish Church incense is used in many ceremonies, and
particularly at the solemn funerals of the hierarchy, and other
personages of exalted rank.</p><p>Pliny makes a note of the tree from which frankincense is procured, and
certain passages in his works indicate that dried flowers were used in
his time by way of perfume, and that they were, as now, mixed with
spices, a compound which the modern perfumer calls <i>pot-pourri</i>, used
for scenting apartments, and generally placed in some ornamental Vase.</p><p>It was not uncommon among the Egyptian ladies to carry about the person
a little pouch of odoriferous gums, as is the case to the present day
among the Chinese, and to wear beads made of scented wood. The
"bdellium" mentioned by Moses in Genesis is a perfuming gum, resembling
frankincense, if not identical with it.</p><p>Several passages in Exodus prove the use of perfumes <a id="Page_23"></a>at a very early
period among the Hebrews. In the thirtieth chapter of Exodus the Lord
said unto Moses: "1. And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon;
of Shittim wood shalt thou make it." "7. And Aaron shall burn thereon
sweet incense every morning; when he dresseth the lamps he shall burn
incense upon it." "34. Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha,
and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall
there be a like weight." "35. And thou shalt make it a perfume, a
confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together pure and
holy." "36. And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it
before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will
meet with thee; it shall be unto you most holy." "37. And as for the
perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according
to the composition thereof; it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord."
"38. Whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto, shall even be
cut off from his people."</p><div class="blockquot"><p>"It was from this religious custom, of employing incense in the
ancient temples, that the royal prophet drew that beautiful simile
of his, when he petitioned that his prayers might ascend before
the Lord like incense, Luke 1:10. It was while all the multitude
was praying without, at the hour of incense, that there appeared
to Zachary an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the
altar of incense. That the nations attached a meaning not only of
personal reverence, but also of religious homage, to an offering
of incense, is demonstrable from the instance of the Magi, who,
having fallen down to adore the new-born Jesus, and recognized his
Divinity, presented Him with gold, myrrh <a id="Page_24"></a>and frankincense. The
primitive Christians imitated the example of the Jews, and adopted
the use of incense at the celebration of the Liturgy. St. Ephræm,
a father of the Syriac Church, directed in his will that no
aromatic perfumes should be bestowed upon him at his funeral, but
that the spices should rather be given to the sanctuary. The use
of incense in all the Oriental churches is perpetual, and almost
daily; nor do any of them ever celebrate their Liturgy without it,
unless compelled by necessity. The Coptic, as well as other
Eastern Christians, observe the same ceremonial as the Latin
Church in incensing their altar, the sacred vessels, and
ecclesiastical personages."—<span class="smcap">Dr. Rock's</span> <i>Hierurgia</i>.</p></div><p>Perfumes were used in the Church service, not only under the form of
incense, but also mixed in the oil and wax for the lamps and lights
commanded to be burned in the house of the Lord. The brilliancy and
fragrance which were often shed around a martyr's sepulchre, at the
celebration of his festival, by multitudes of lamps and tapers, fed with
aromatics, have been noticed by St. Paulinus:—</p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With crowded lamps are these bright altars crowned,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And waxen tapers, shedding perfume round<br></span>
<span class="i0">From fragrant wicks, beam calm a scented ray,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To gladden night, and joy e'en radiant day."<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Dr. Rock's</span> <i>Hierurgia</i>.<br></span>
</div></div><p>Constantine the Great provided fragrant oils, to be burned at the altars
of the greater churches in Rome; and St. Paulinus, of Nola, a writer of
the end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century, tells us how,
in his times, wax tapers were made for church use, so as to shed
fragrance as they burned:—</p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Lumina cerates adolentur odora papyris."</p></div><p><a id="Page_25"></a>A perfume in common use, even to this day, was the invention of one of
the earliest of the Roman nobles, named Frangipani, and still bears his
name; it is a powder, or sachet, composed of every known spice, in equal
proportions, to which is added ground iris or orris root, in weight
equal to the whole, with one per cent. of musk or civet. A liquid of the
same name, invented by his grandson Mercutio Frangipani, is also in
common use, prepared by digesting the Frangipane powder in rectified
spirits, which dissolves out the fragrant principles. This has the merit
of being the most lasting perfume made.</p><div class="blockquot"><p>"The trade for the East in perfume-drugs caused many a vessel to
spread its sails to the Red Sea, and many a camel to plod over
that tract which gave to Greece and Syria their importance as
markets, and vitality to the rocky city of Petra. Southern Italy
was not long ere it occupied itself in ministering to the luxury
of the wealthy, by manufacturing scented unguents and perfumes. So
numerous were the <span class="smcap">Unguentarii</span>, or perfumers, that they
are said to have filled the great street of ancient
Capua."—<span class="smcap">Hofmann</span>.</p></div><p>As an art, in England, perfumery has attained little or no distinction.
This has arisen from those who follow it as a trade, maintaining a
mysterious secrecy about their processes. No manufacture can ever become
great or important to the community that is carried on under a veil of
mystery.</p><div class="blockquot"><p>"On the subject of trade mystery I will only observe, that I am
convinced that it would be far more to the interest of
manufacturers if they were more willing to profit by the
experience of others, and less fearful and jealous of the supposed
secrets of their craft. It is a great mistake to think that a
successful <a id="Page_26"></a>manufacturer is one who has carefully preserved the
secrets of his trade, or that peculiar modes of effecting simple
things, processes unknown in other factories, and mysteries beyond
the comprehension of the vulgar, are in any way essential to skill
as a manufacturer, or to success as a trader."—<span class="smcap">Professor
Solly</span>.</p></div><p>If the horticulturists of England were instructed how to collect the
odors of flowers, a new branch of manufacture would spring up to vie
with our neighbors' skill in it across the Channel.</p><p>Of our five senses, that of <span class="smcap">Smelling</span> has been treated with
comparative indifference. However, as knowledge progresses, the various
faculties with which the Creator has thought proper in his wisdom to
endow man will become developed, and the faculty of Smelling will meet
with its share of tuition as well as Sight, Hearing, Touch, and Taste.</p><p>Flowers yield perfumes in all climates, but those growing in the warmer
latitudes are most prolific in their odor, while those from the colder
are the sweetest. Hooker, in his travels in Iceland, speaks of the
delightful fragrance of the flowers in the valley of Skardsheidi; we
know that winter-green, violets, and primroses are found here, and the
wild thyme, in great abundance. Mr. Louis Piesse, in company with
Captain Sturt, exploring the wild regions of South Australia, writes:
"The rains have clothed the earth with a green as beautiful as a
Shropshire meadow in May, and with flowers, too, as sweet as an English
violet; the pure white anemone resembles it in scent. The Yellow Wattle,
<a id="Page_27"></a>when in flower, is splendid, and emits a most fragrant odor."</p><p>Though many of the finest perfumes come from the East Indies, Ceylon,
Mexico, and Peru, the South of Europe is the only real garden of utility
to the perfumer. Grasse and Nice are the principal seats of the art;
from their geographical position, the grower, within comparatively short
distances, has at command that change of climate best fitted to bring to
perfection the plants required for his trade. On the seacoast his Cassiæ
grows without fear of frost, one night of which would destroy all the
plants for a season; while, nearer the Alps, his violets are found
sweeter than if grown in the warmer situations, where the orange tree
and mignionette bloom to perfection. England can claim the superiority
in the growth of lavender and peppermint; the essential oils extracted
from these plants grown at Mitcham, in Surrey, realize eight times the
price in the market of those produced in France or elsewhere, and are
fully worth the difference for delicacy of odor.</p><p>The odors of plants reside in different parts of them, sometimes in the
roots, as in the iris and vitivert; the stem or wood, in cedar and
sandal; the leaves, in mint, patchouly, and thyme; the flower, in the
roses and violets; the seeds in the Tonquin bean and caraway; the bark,
in cinnamon, &amp;c.</p><p>Some plants yield more than one odor, which are quite distinct and
characteristic. The orange tree, for instance, gives three—from the
leaves one called<a id="Page_28"></a> <i>petit grain</i>; from the flowers we procure <i>neroli</i>;
and from the rind of the fruit, essential oil of orange, <i>essence of
Portugal</i>. On this account, perhaps, this tree is the most valuable of
all to the operative perfumer.</p><p>The fragrance or odor of plants is owing, in nearly all cases, to a
perfectly volatile oil, either contained in small vessels, or sacs
within them, or generated from time to time, during their life, as when
in blossom. Some few exude, by incision, odoriferous gums, as benzoin,
olibanum, myrrh, &amp;c.; others give, by the same act, what are called
balsams, which appear to be mixtures of an odorous oil and an inodorous
gum. Some of these balsams are procured in the country to which the
plant is indigenous by boiling it in water for a time, straining, and
then boiling again, or evaporating it down till it assumes the
consistency of treacle. In this latter way is balsam of Peru procured
from the <i>Myroxylon peruiferum</i>, and the balsam of Tolu from the
<i>Myroxylon toluiferum</i>. Though their odors are agreeable, they are not
much applied in perfumery for handkerchief use, but by some they are
mixed with soap, and in England they are valued more for their medicinal
properties than for their fragrance.</p><hr style="width: 65%;">`
