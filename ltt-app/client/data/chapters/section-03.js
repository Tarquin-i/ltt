In macerating, the heat is applied in the same way,\nor by a contrivance like the common glue-pot, as made use of nowadays.</p><p>This description of apparatus will be found very useful for experiments\nwhich we will suggest by-and-by.</p><p>The perfumes for the handkerchief, as found in the shops of Paris and\nLondon, are either simple or compound; the former are called extracts,\n<i>extraits</i>, <i>esprits</i>, or essences, and the latter <i>bouquets</i> and\nnosegays, which are mixtures of the extracts so compounded in quantity\nthat no one flower or odor can be discovered as predominating over\nanother; and when made of the delicate-scented flowers carefully\nblended, they produce an exquisite sensation on the <a></a>olfactory nerve,\nand are therefore much prized by all who can afford to purchase them.</p><p>We shall first explain the mode for obtaining the simple extracts of\nflowers. This will be followed by the process for preparing ambergris,\nmusk, and civet, substances, which, though of animal origin, are of the\nutmost importance as forming a large part in the most approved bouquets;\nand we shall conclude this department of the art with recipes for all\nthe fashionable bouquets and nosegays, the value of which, we doubt not,\nwill be estimated according to the labor bestowed upon their analysis.</p><p>In order to render the work more easy of consultation, we have adopted\nthe alphabetical arrangement in preference to a more scientific\nclassification.</p><p>Among the collection of ottos of the East India Company at the\nExhibition of 1851, were several hitherto unknown in this country, and\npossessing much interest.</p><p>It is to be regretted, that no person having any practical knowledge of\nperfumery was placed on the jury of Class IV or XXIX. Had such been the\ncase, the desires of the exhibitors would probably have been realized,\nand European perfumers benefited by the introduction of new odors from\nthe East. Some of the ottos sent by a native perfumer of Benares were\ndeemed worthy of honorable mention. Such as <i>Chumeylee</i>, <i>Beyla</i>,\n<i>Begla</i>, <i>Moteya</i>, and many others from the Moluccas, but without any\ninformation respecting them.</p><p>We are not going to speak of, perhaps, more than <a></a>a tithe of the plants\nthat have a perfume—only those will be mentioned that are used by the\noperative perfumer, and such as are imitated by him in consequence of\nthere being a demand for the article, which circumstances prevent him\nfrom obtaining in its genuine state. The first that comes under our\nnotice is—</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Allspice.</span>—The odoriferous principle of allspice, commonly\ncalled pimento, is obtained by distilling the dried fruit, before it is\nquite ripe, of the <i>Eugenia pimenta</i> and <i>Myrtus pimenta</i> with water. It\nis thus procured as an essential oil; it is but little used in\nperfumery, and when so, only in combination with other spice oils; for\nscenting soap it is, however, very agreeable, and much resembles the\nsmell of cloves, and deserves more attention than it has hitherto\nreceived. Mixed in the proportion of two ounces of oil of allspice with\none gallon of rectified spirit of wine, it forms what may be termed\nextract of allspice, which extract will be found very useful in the\nmanufacture of low-priced bouquets.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Almonds.</span></p><div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\">\"Mark well the flow'ring almonds in the wood;<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">If od'rous blooms the bearing branches load,<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">The glebe will answer to the sylvan reign,<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">Great heats will follow, and large crops of grain.\"<br></span>\n</div><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\"><span class=\"smcap\">Virgil.</span><br></span>\n</div></div><p>This perfume has been much esteemed for many ages. It may be procured by\ndistilling the leaves of any of the laurel tribe, and the kernels of\nstone fruit; for trade purposes, it is obtained from the <a></a>bitter\nalmonds, and exists in the skin or pellicle that covers the seed after\nit is shelled. In the ordinary way, the almonds are put into the press\nfor the purpose of obtaining the mild or fat oil from the nut; the cake\nwhich is left after this process is then mixed with salt and water, and\nallowed to remain together for about twenty-four hours prior to\ndistillation. The reason for moistening the cake is well understood to\nthe practical chemist, and although we are not treating the subject of\nperfumery in a chemical sense, but only in a practical way, it may not\nbe inappropriate here to observe, that the essential oil of almonds does\nnot exist ready formed to any extent in the nut, but that it is produced\nby a species of fermentation, from the amygdalin and emulsine contained\nin the almonds, together with the water that is added. Analogous\nsubstances exist in laurel leaves, and hence the same course is to be\npursued when they are distilled. Some manufacturers put the moistened\ncake into a bag of coarse <a></a>cloth, or spread it upon a sieve, and then\nforce the stream through it; in either case, the essential oil of the\nalmond rises with the watery vapor, and is condensed in the still-worm.\nIn this concentrated form, the odor of almonds is far from agreeable;\nbut when diluted with spirit, in the proportion of about one and a half\nounce of the oil to a gallon of spirit or alcohol, it is very pleasant.</p><p><a id=\"almond\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 361px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption3\">\n<img alt=\"Almond.\" height=\"350\" src=\"/static/images/book/image039.png\" title=\"\" width=\"361\" id=\"img_images_image039.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption3\">Almond.</span>\n</div><p>The essential oil of almonds, enters into combination with soap, cold\ncream, and many other materials prepared by the perfumer; for which see\ntheir respective titles.</p><p>Fourteen pounds of the cake yield about one ounce of essential oil.</p><p>In experiments with this substance, it must be carefully remembered that\nit is exceedingly <i>poisonous</i>, and, therefore, great caution is\nnecessary in its admixture with substances used as a cosmetic, otherwise\ndangerous results may ensue.</p><p><i>Artificial Otto of Almonds.</i>—Five or six years ago, Mr. Mansfield, of\nWeybridge, took out a patent for the manufacture of otto of almonds from\nbenzole. (Benzole is obtained from tar oil.) His apparatus, according to\nthe Report of the juries of the 1851 Exhibition, consists of a large\nglass tube in the form of a coil, which at the upper end divides into\ntwo tubes; each of which is provided with a funnel. A stream of nitric\nacid flows slowly into one of the funnels, and benzole into the other.\nThe two substances meet at the point of union of the tubes, and a\ncombination ensues with the evolution of heat. As the <a></a>newly formed\ncompound flows down through the coil it becomes cool, and is collected\nat the lower extremity; it then requires to be washed with water, and\nlastly with a dilute solution of carbonate of soda, to render it fit for\nuse. Nitro-benzole, which is the chemical name for this artificial otto\nof almonds, has a different odor to the true otto of almonds, but it can\nnevertheless be used for perfuming soap. Mr. Mansfield writes to me\nunder date of January 3d, 1855:—\"In 1851, Messrs. Gosnell, of Three\nKing Court, began to make this perfume under my license; latterly I\nwithdrew the license from them by their consent, and since then it is\nnot made that I am aware of.\" It is, however, quite common in Paris.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Anise.</span>—The odorous principle is procured by distilling the\nseeds of the plant <i>Pimpinella anisum</i>; the product is the oil of\naniseed of commerce. As it congeals at a temperature of about 50° Fahr.,\nit is frequently adulterated with a little spermaceti, to give a certain\nsolidity to it, whereby other cheaper essential oils can be added to it\nwith less chance of detection. As the oil of aniseed is quite soluble in\nspirit, and the spermaceti insoluble, the fraud is easily detected.</p><p>This perfume is exceedingly strong, and is, therefore, well adapted for\nmixing with soap and for scenting pomatums, but does not do nicely in\ncompounds for handkerchief use.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Balm</span>, oil of Balm, called also oil of Melissa, is obtained by\ndistilling the leaves of the <i>Melissa officinalis</i> with water; it comes\nfrom the still tap with the condensed <a></a>steam or water, from which it is\nseparated with the tap funnel. But it is very little used in perfumery,\nif we except its combination in <i>Aqua di Argento</i>.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Balsam.</span>—Under this title there are two or three substances\nused in perfumery, such as balsam of Peru, balsam of Tolu, and balsam of\nstorax (also called liquid amber). The first-named, is procured from the\n<i>Myroxylon peruiferum</i>; it exudes from the tree when wounded, and is\nalso obtained by boiling down the bark and branches in water. The latter\nis the most common method for procuring it. It has a strong odor, like\nbenzoin.</p><p>Balsam of Tolu flows from the <i>Toluifera balsammum</i>. It resembles common\nresin (rosin); with the least warmth, however, it runs to a liquid, like\nbrown treacle. The smell of it is particularly agreeable, and being\nsoluble in alcohol makes a good basis for a bouquet, giving in this\nrespect a permanence of odor to a perfume which the simple solution of\nan oil would not possess. For this purpose all these balsams are very\nuseful, though not so much used as they might be.</p><div class=\"blockquot\"><p>\"<span class=\"smcap\">Ulex</span> has found that balsam of Tolu is frequently\nadulterated with common resin. To detect this adulteration he\npours sulphuric acid on the balsam, and heats the mixture, when\nthe balsam dissolves to a cherry-red fluid, without evolving\nsulphurous acid, but with the escape of benzoic or cinnamic acid,\nif no common resin is present. On the contrary, the balsam foams,\nblackens, and much sulphurous acid is set free, if it is\nadulterated with common resin.\"—<i>Archives der Pharmacie</i>.</p></div><p>Balsam of storax, commonly called gum styrax, is obtained in the same\nmanner, and possessing similar <a></a>properties, with a slight variation of\nodor, is applicable in the same manner as the above.</p><p>They are all imported from South America, Chili, and Mexico, where the\ntrees that produce them are indigenous.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Bay</span>, oil of sweet Bay, also termed essential oil of\nlaurel-berries, is a very fragrant substance, procured by distillation\nfrom the berries of the bay laurel. Though very pleasant, it is not much\nused.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Bergamot.</span>—This most useful perfume is procured from the\n<i>Citrus Bergamia</i>, by expression from the peel of the fruit. It has a\nsoft sweet odor, too well known to need description here. When new and\ngood it has a greenish-yellow tint, but loses its greenness by age,\nespecially if kept in imperfectly corked bottles. It then becomes cloudy\nfrom the deposit of resinous matter, produced by the contact of the air,\nand acquires a turpentine smell.</p><p>It is best preserved in well-stoppered bottles, kept in a cool cellar,\nand in the dark; light, especially the direct sunshine, quickly\ndeteriorates its odor. This observation may be applied, indeed, to all\nperfumes, except rose, which is not so spoiled.</p><p>When bergamot is mixed with other essential oils it greatly adds to\ntheir richness, and gives a sweetness to spice oils attainable by no\nother means, and such compounds are much used in the most highly scented\nsoaps. Mixed with rectified spirit in the proportions of about four\nounces of bergamot to a gallon, it forms what is called \"extract of\nbergamot,\" and in this state is used for the handkerchief. Though <a></a>well\ncovered with extract of orris and other matters, it is the leading\ningredient in Bayley and Blew's Ess. Bouquet (see <span class=\"smcap\">Bouquets</span>).</p><p><a id=\"styrax\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 304px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption4\">\n<img alt=\"Styrax Benzoin.\" height=\"391\" src=\"/static/images/book/image044.png\" title=\"\" width=\"304\" id=\"img_images_image044.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption4\">Styrax Benzoin.</span>\n</div><p><span class=\"smcap\">Benzoin</span>, also called Benjamin.—This is a very useful substance\nto perfumers. It exudes from the <i>Styrax benzoin</i> by wounding the tree,\nand drying, becomes a hard gum-resin. It is principally imported from\nBorneo, Java, Sumatra, and Siam. The best kind comes from the latter\nplace, and used to be called Amygdaloides, because of its being\ninterspersed with several white spots, which resemble broken almonds.\nWhen heated, these white specks rise as a smoke, which is easily\ncondensed upon paper. The material thus separated from the benzoin is\ncalled flowers of benzoin in commerce, and by chemists is termed benzoic\nacid. It has all, or nearly all, the odor of the resin from which it is\nderived.</p><p>The extract, or tincture of benzoin, forms a good <a></a>basis for a\nbouquet.<a></a><a class=\"fnanchor pginternal\" href=\"#Footnote_B_2\">[B]</a> Like balsam of Tolu, it gives permanence and body to a\nperfume made with an essential oil in spirit.</p><p>The principal consumption of benzoin is in the manufacture of pastilles\n(see <span class=\"smcap\">Pastilles</span>), and for the preparation of fictitious vanilla\npomade (see <span class=\"smcap\">Pomatums</span>).</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Caraway.</span>—This odoriferous principle is drawn by distillation\nfrom the seeds of the <i>Carum carui</i>. It has a very pleasant smell, quite\nfamiliar enough without description. It is well adapted to perfume soap,\nfor which it is much used in England, though rarely if ever on the\ncontinent; when dissolved in spirit it may be used in combination with\noil of lavender and bergamot for the manufacture of cheap essences, in a\nsimilar way to cloves (see <span class=\"smcap\">Cloves</span>). If caraway seeds are\nground, they are well adapted for mixing to form sachet powder (see\n<span class=\"smcap\">Sachets</span>).</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Cascarilla.</span>—The bark is used in the formation of pastilles,\nand also enters into the composition known as <i>Eau à Bruler</i>, for\nperfuming apartments, to which we refer.</p><p>The bark alone of this plant is used by the manufacturing perfumer, and\nthat only in the fabrication of pastilles. The <i>Cascarilla gratissimus</i>\nis however so fragrant, that according to Burnett its leaves are\ngathered by the Koras of the Cape of Good Hope as a perfume, and both\nthe <i>C. fragrans</i> and <i>C. fragilis</i> are odoriferous. It behooves\nperfumers, therefore, <a></a>who are on the look out for novelties, to obtain\nthese leaves and ascertain the result of their distillation.</p><p>Messrs. Herring and Co., some years ago, drew the oil of cascarilla, but\nit was only offered to the trade as a curiosity.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Cassia.</span>—The essential oil of cassia is procured by distilling\nthe outer bark of the <i>Cinnamomum cassia</i>. 1 cwt. of bark yields rather\nmore than three quarters of a pound of oil; it has a pale yellow color;\nin smell it much resembles cinnamon, although very inferior to it. It is\nprincipally used for perfuming soap, especially what is called \"military\nsoap,\" as it is more aromatic or spicy than flowery in odor; it\ntherefore finds no place for handkerchief use.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Cassie.—</span></p><div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\">\"The short narcissus and fair daffodil,<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">Pansies to please the sight, and <i>cassie</i> sweet to swell.\"<br></span>\n</div><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\"><span class=\"smcap\">Dryden's</span> <i>Virgil</i>.<br></span>\n</div></div><p>This is one of those fine odors which enters into the composition of the\nbest handkerchief bouquets.</p><p><a id=\"Acacia\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 524px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption5\">\n<img alt=\"Flower-buds of the Acacia Farnesiana.\" height=\"237\" src=\"/static/images/book/image046.png\" title=\"\" width=\"524\" id=\"img_images_image046.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption5\">Flower-buds of the Acacia Farnesiana.</span>\n</div><p>When smelled at alone, it has an intense violet odor, and is rather\nsickly sweet.</p><p><a></a>It is procured by maceration from the <i>Acacia farnesiana</i>. The purified\nfat is melted, into which the flowers are thrown and left to digest for\nseveral hours; the spent flowers are removed, and fresh are added, eight\nor ten times, until sufficient richness of perfume is obtained. As many\nflowers are used as the grease will cover, when they are put into it, in\na liquid state.</p><p>After being strained, and the pomade has been kept at a heat sufficient\nonly to retain its liquidity, all impurities will subside by standing\nfor a few days. Finally cooled, it is the cassie pomade of commerce. The\n<i>Huile de Cassie</i>, or fat oil of cassie, is prepared in a similar\nmanner, substituting the oil of Egyptian ben nut, olive oil, or almond\noil, in place of suet. Both these preparations are obviously only a\nsolution of the true essential oil of cassie flowers in the neutral\nfatty body. Europe may shortly be expecting to import a similar scented\npomade from South Australia, derived from the Wattle, a plant that\nbelongs to the same genus as the <i>A. farnesiana</i>, and which grows most\nluxuriantly in Australia. Mutton fat being cheap, and the wattle\nplentiful, a profitable trade may be anticipated in curing the flowers,\n&amp;c.</p><p>To prepare the extract of cassie, take six pounds of No. 24 (best\nquality) cassie pomade, and place upon it one gallon of the best\nrectified spirit, as sent out by Bowerbank, of Bishopsgate. After it has\ndigested for three weeks or a month, at a summer heat, it is fit to draw\nfrom the pomatum, and, if good, has a beautiful green color and rich\nflowery <a></a>smell of the cassie blossom. All extracts made by this\nprocess—<i>maceration</i>, or, as it may be called, cold <i>infusion</i>, give a\nmore natural smell of the flowers to the result, than by merely\ndissolving the essential oil (procured by distillation) in the spirit;\nmoreover, where the odor of the flower exists in only very minute\nquantities, as in the present instance, and with violet, jasmine, &amp;c.,\nit is the only practical mode of proceeding.</p><p>In this, and all other similar cases, the pomatum must be cut up into\nvery small pieces, after the domestic manner of \"chopping suet,\" prior\nto its being infused in the alcohol. The action of the mixture is simply\na change of place in the odoriferous matter, which leaves the fat body\nby the superior attraction, or affinity, as the chemists say, of the\nspirits of wine, in which it freely dissolves.</p><p>The major part of the extract can be poured or drawn off the pomatum\nwithout trouble, but it still retains a portion in the interstices,\nwhich requires time to drain away, and this must be assisted by placing\nthe pomatum in a large funnel, supported by a bottle, in order to\ncollect the remainder. Finally, all the pomatum, which is now called\n<i>washed pomatum</i>, is to be put into a tin, which tin must be set into\nhot water, for the purpose of melting its contents; when the pomatum\nthus becomes liquefied, any extract that is still in it rises to the\nsurface, and can be skimmed off, or when the pomatum becomes cold it can\nbe poured from it.</p><p>The washed pomatum is preserved for use in the <a></a>manufacture of dressing\nfor the hair, for which purpose it is exceedingly well adapted, on\naccount of the purity of the grease from which it was originally\nprepared, but more particularly on account of a certain portion of odor\nwhich it still retains; and were it not used up in this way, it would be\nadvisable to put it for a second infusion in spirit, and thus a weaker\nextract could be made serviceable for lower priced articles.</p><p>I cannot leave cassie without recommending it more especially to the\nnotice of perfumers and druggists, as an article well adapted for the\npurpose of the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief and pomades\nfor the hair. When diluted with other odors, it imparts to the whole\nsuch a true flowery fragrance, that it is the admiration of all who\nsmell it, and has not a little contributed to the great sale which\ncertain proprietary articles have attained.</p><p>We caution the inexperienced not to confound cassie with cassia, which\nhas a totally different odor. See <span class=\"smcap\">Acacia Pomade</span>.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Cedar Wood</span> now and then finds a place in a perfumer's\nwarehouse; when ground, it does well to form a body for sachet powder.\nSlips of cedar wood are sold as matches for lighting lamps, because\nwhile burning an agreeable odor is evolved; some people use it also, in\nthis condition, distributed among clothes in drawers to \"prevent moth.\"\nOn distillation it yields an essential oil that is exceedingly fragrant.</p><p>Messrs. Rigge and Co., of London, use it extensively for scenting soap.</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\"><a></a>Lebanon Cedar Wood</span>.

It forms an excellent tincture for the teeth, and is the\nbasis of the celebrated French dentifrice \"eau Botot.\"</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Cedrat</span>.—This perfume is procured from the rind of the citron\nfruit (<i>Citrus medica</i>), both by distillation and expression; it has a\nvery beautiful lemony odor, and is much admired. It is principally used\nin the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief, being too expensive\nfor perfuming grease or soap. What is called extract of cedrat is made\nby dissolving two ounces of the above essential oil of citron in one\npint of spirits, to which some perfumers add half an ounce of bergamot.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Cinnamon</span>.—Several species of the plant <i>Laurus cinnamomum</i>\nyield the cinnamon and cassia of commerce. Its name is said to be\nderived from <i>China Amomum</i>, the bark being one of the most valued\nspices of the East. Perfumers use both the bark and the oil, which is\nobtained by distillation from it. The ground bark enters into the\ncomposition of some pastilles, tooth powders, and sachets. The essential\noil of cinnamon is principally brought to this country from Ceylon; it\nis exceedingly powerful, and must <a></a>be used sparingly. In such compounds\nas cloves answer, so will cinnamon.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Citron</span>.—On distilling the flowers of the <i>Citrus medica</i>, a\nvery fragrant oil is procured, which is a species of neroli, and is\nprincipally consumed by the manufacturers of eau de Cologne.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Citronella</span>.—Under this name there is an oil in the market,\nchiefly derived from Ceylon and the East Indies; its true origin we are\nunable to decide; in odor it somewhat resembles citron fruit, but is\nvery inferior. Probably it is procured from one of the grasses of the\n<i>Andropogon</i> genus. Being cheap, it is extensively used for perfuming\nsoap. What is now extensively sold as \"honey\" soap, is a fine yellow\nsoap slightly perfumed with this oil. Some few use it for scenting\ngrease, but it is not much admired in that way.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Cloves</span>.—Every part of the clove plant (<i>Caryophyllus\naromaticus</i>) abounds with aromatic oil, but it is most fragrant and\nplentiful in the unexpanded <a></a>flower-bud, which are the cloves of\ncommerce. Cloves have been brought into the European market for more\nthan 2000 years. The plant is a native of the Moluccas and other islands\nin the China seas. \"The average annual crop of cloves,\" says Burnett,\n\"is, from each tree, 2 or 2-1/2 lbs., but a fine tree has been known to\nyield 125 lbs. of this spice in a single season, and as 5000 cloves only\nweigh one pound, there must have been at least 625,000 flowers upon this\nsingle tree.\"</p><p><a id=\"Clove\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 355px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption6\">\n<img alt=\"Clove.\" height=\"322\" src=\"/static/images/book/image051.png\" title=\"\" width=\"355\" id=\"img_images_image051.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption6\">Clove.</span>\n</div><p>The oil of cloves may be obtained by expression from the fresh\nflower-buds, but the usual method of procuring it is by distillation,\nwhich is carried on to a very great extent in this country.

For essence of cloves, dissolve oil of cloves in the\nproportion of two ounces of oil to one gallon of spirit.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Dill</span>.—Perfumers are now and then asked for \"dill water;\" it\nis, however, more a druggist's article than a perfumer's, as it is more\nused for its medicinal qualities than for its odor, which by the way, is\nrather pleasant than otherwise. Some ladies use a mixture of half dill\nwater and half rose water, as a simple cosmetic, \"to clear the\ncomplexion.\"</p><p>The oil of dill is procured by submitting the <a></a>crushed fruit of dill\n(<i>Anethum graveolens</i>) with water to distillation. The oil floats on the\nsurface of the distillate, from which it is separated by the funnel in\nthe usual manner; after the separation of the oil, the \"water\" is fit\nfor sale. Oil of dill may be used with advantage, if in small\nproportions, and mixed with other oils, for perfuming soap.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Eglantine</span>, or <span class=\"smcap\">Sweet Briar</span>, notwithstanding what the\npoet Robert Noyes says—</p><div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i8\">\"In fragrance yields,<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">Surpassing citron groves or spicy fields,\"<br></span>\n</div></div><p>does not find a place in the perfumer's \"scent-room\" except in name.\nThis, like many other sweet-scented plants, does not repay the labor of\ncollecting its odor.

Two or three new\nmaterials made from this flower will also be given hereafter, which are\nlikely to meet with a very large sale on account of the reputed cooling\nqualities of the ingredients; of these we would call attention more\nparticularly to cold cream of elder-flowers, and to elder oil for the\nhair.</p><p>The preparations of elder-flowers, if made according to the\nPharmacopœias, are perfectly useless, as the forms therein given show\nan utter want of knowledge of the properties of the materials employed.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Fennel</span> (<i>Fœniculum vulgare</i>).—Dried fennel herb, when\nground, enters into the composition of some sachet powders. The oil of\nfennel, in conjunction with other aromatic oils, may be used for\nperfuming soap. It is procurable by distillation.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Flag</span> (<span class=\"smcap\">Sweet</span>) (<i>Acorus calamus</i>).—The roots, or\nrhizome, of the sweet flag, yield by distillation a pleasant-smelling\noil; 1 cwt. of the rhizome will thus yield one pound of oil. It can be\nused according to the pleasure of the manufacturer in scenting grease,\nsoap, or for extracts, but requires other sweet oils with it to hide its\norigin.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\"><a></a>Geranium</span> (<i>Pelargonium odoratissimum</i>, rose-leaf\ngeranium).—The leaves of this plant yield by distillation a very\nagreeable rosy-smelling oil, so much resembling real otto of rose, that\nit is used very extensively for the adulteration of that valuable oil,\nand is grown very largely for that express purpose. It is principally\ncultivated in the south of France, and in Turkey (by the rose-growers).\nIn the department of Seine-et-Oise, at Montfort-Lamaury, in France,\nhundreds of acres of it may be seen growing. 1 cwt. of leaves will yield\nabout two ounces of essential oil. Used to adulterate otto of rose, it\nis in its turn itself adulterated with ginger grass oil (<i>Andropogon</i>),\nand thus formerly was very difficult to procure genuine; on account of\nthe increased cultivation of the plant, it is now, however, easily\nprocured pure. Some samples are greenish-colored, others nearly white,\nbut we prefer that of a brownish tint.</p><p>When dissolved in rectified spirit, in the proportion of about six\nounces to the gallon, it forms the \"extract of rose-leaf geranium\" of\nthe shops. A word or two is necessary about the oil of geranium, as much\nconfusion is created respecting it, in consequence of there being an oil\nunder the name of geranium, but which in reality is derived from the\n<i>Andropogon nardus</i>, cultivated in the Moluccas. This said andropogon\n(geranium!) oil can be used to adulterate the true geranium, and hence\nwe suppose its nomenclature in the drug markets. The genuine rose-leaf\ngeranium oil fetches about 6<i>s.</i> per ounce, while the andropogon oil is\nnot worth more than that <a></a>sum per pound. And we may observe here, that\nthe perfuming essential oils are best purchased through the wholesale\nperfumers, as from the nature of their trade they have a better\nknowledge and means of obtaining the real article than the drug-broker.\nOn account of the pleasing odor of the true oil of rose-leaf geranium,\nit is a valuable article for perfuming many materials, and appears to\ngive the public great satisfaction.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Heliotrope.</span>—Either by maceration or enfleurage with clarified\nfat, we may obtain this fine odor from the flowers of the <i>Heliotrope\nPeruvianum</i> or <i>H. grandiflorum</i>. Exquisite as the odor of this plant\nis, at present it is not applied to use by the manufacturing perfumer.\nThis we think rather a singular fact, especially as the perfume is\npowerful and the flowers abundant. We should like to hear of some\nexperiments being tried with this plant for procuring its odor in this\ncountry, and for that purpose now suggest the mode of operation which\nwould most likely lead to successful results. For a small trial in the\nfirst instance, which can be managed by any person having the run of a\ngarden, we will say, procure an ordinary glue-pot now in common use,\nwhich melts the material by the boiling of water; it is in fact a\nwater-bath, in chemical parlance—one capable of holding a pound or more\nof melted fat. At the season when the flowers are in bloom, obtain half\na pound of fine mutton suet, melt the suet and strain it through a close\nhair-sieve, allow the liquefied fat, as it falls from the sieve, to drop\ninto cold spring water; <a></a>this operation granulates and washes the blood\nand membrane from it. In order to start with a perfectly inodorous\ngrease, the melting and granulation process may be repeated three or\nfour times; finally, remelt the fat and cast it into a pan to free it\nfrom adhering water.</p><p>Now put the clarified suet into the macerating pot, and place it in such\na position near the fire of the greenhouse, or elsewhere that will keep\nit warm enough to be liquid; into the fat throw as many flowers as you\ncan, and there let them remain for twenty-four hours; at this time\nstrain the fat from the spent flowers and add fresh ones; repeat this\noperation for a week: we expect at the last straining the fat will have\nbecome very highly perfumed, and when cold may be justly termed <i>Pomade\nà la Heliotrope</i>.</p><p>The cold pomade being chopped up, like suet for a pudding, is now to be\nput into a wide-mouthed bottle, and covered with spirits as highly\nrectified as can be obtained, and left to digest for a week or more; the\nspirit then strained off will be highly perfumed; in reality it will be\n<i>extract of Heliotrope</i>, a delightful perfume for the handkerchief. The\nrationale of the operation is simple enough: the fat body has a strong\naffinity or attraction for the odorous body, or essential oil of the\nflowers, and it therefore absorbs it by contact, and becomes itself\nperfumed. In the second operation, the spirit has a much greater\nattraction for the fragrant principle than the fatty matter; the former,\ntherefore, becomes perfumed at the expense <a></a>of the latter. The same\nexperiment may be repeated with almond oil substituted for the fat.</p><p>The experiment here hinted at, may be varied with any flowers that there\nare to spare; indeed, by having the macerating bath larger than was\nmentioned above, an excellent <i>millefleur</i> pomade and essence might be\nproduced from every conservatory in the kingdom, and thus we may receive\nanother enjoyment from the cultivation of flowers beyond their beauty of\nform and color.</p><p>We hope that those of our readers who feel inclined to try experiments\nof this nature will not be deterred by saying, \"they are not worth the\ntrouble.\" It must be remembered, that very fine essences realize in the\nLondon perfumery warehouses 16<i>s.</i> per pint of 16 ounces, and that fine\n<i>flowery-scented</i> pomades fetch the same sum per pound. If the\nexperiments are successful they should be published, as then we may hope\nto establish a new and important manufacture in this country. But we are\ndigressing.</p><p>The odor of heliotrope resembles a mixture of almonds and vanilla, and\nis well imitated thus:—</p><h4> <span class=\"smcap\">Extract of Heliotrope.</span></h4><div class=\"center\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Spirituous extract of vanilla,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2 pint.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French rose pomatum,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/4&nbsp;&nbsp;\"</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orange-flower pomatum,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 oz.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambergris,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 oz.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Essential oil of almonds,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">5 drops.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table></div><p>A preparation made in this manner under the name <a></a>of <i>Extract de\nHeliotrope</i> is that which is sold in the shops of Paris and London, and\nis really a very nice perfume, passing well with the public for a\ngenuine extract of heliotrope.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Honeysuckle</span> or <span class=\"smcap\">Woodbine</span>:—</p><div class=\"poem\"><div class=\"stanza\">\n<span class=\"i0\">\"Copious of flower the woodbine, pale and wan,<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">But well compensating her sickly looks<br></span>\n<span class=\"i0\">With never-cloying odors.\"<br></span>\n</div></div><p>What the poet Cowper here says is quite true; nevertheless, it is a\nflower that is not used in practical perfumery, though there is no\nreason for abandoning it.

Its odor is\ndelicate and sweet, and so peculiar that it is without comparison, and\nas such cannot be imitated. When the flowers of the <i>Jasminum\nodoratissimum</i><a></a> are distilled, repeatedly using the water of\ndistillation over fresh flowers, the essential oil of jasmine may be\nprocured. It is, however, exceedingly rare, on account of the enormous\ncost of production. There was a fine sample of six ounces exhibited in\nthe Tunisian department of the Crystal Palace, the price of which was\n9<i>l.</i> the fluid ounce! The plant is the Yasmyn of the Arabs, from which\nour name is derived.</p><p>In the perfumer's laboratory, the method of obtaining the odor is by\nabsorption, or, as the French term it, <i>enfleurage</i>; that is, by\nspreading a mixture of pure lard and suet on a glass tray, and sticking\nthe fresh-gathered flowers all over it, leaving them to stand a day or\nso, and repeating the operation with fresh flowers—the grease absorbs\nthe odor. Finally, the pomade is scraped off the glass or slate, melted\nat as low a temperature as possible, and strained.</p><p>Oils strongly impregnated with the fragrance are also prepared much in\nthe same way. Layers of cotton wool, previously steeped in oil of ben\n(obtained by pressure from the blanched nuts of the <i>Moringa oleifera</i>)\nare covered with jasmine flowers, which is repeated several times;\nfinally, the cotton or linen cloths which some perfumers use, are\nsqueezed under a press. The jasmine oil thus produced is the <i>Huile\nantique au jasmin</i> of the French houses.</p><p>The \"extract of jasmine\" is prepared by pouring rectified spirit on the\njasmine pomade or oil, and allowing them to remain together for a\nfortnight at a summer heat. The best quality extract requires two\n<a></a>pounds of pomatum to every quart of spirit. The same can be done with\nthe oil of jasmine. If the pomade is used, it must be cut up fine\npreviously to being put into the spirit; if the oil is used, it must be\nshaken well together every two or more hours, otherwise, on account of\nits specific gravity, the oil separates, and but little surface is\nexposed to the spirit. After the extract is strained off, the \"washed\"\npomatum or oil is still useful, if remelted, in the composition of\npomatum for the hair, and gives more satisfaction to a customer than any\nof the \"creams and balms,\" &amp;c. &amp;c., made up and scented with essential\noils; the one smells of the flower, the other \"a nondescript.\"</p><p><a id=\"jasmine\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 307px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption7\">\n<img alt=\"Jasmine.\" height=\"341\" src=\"/static/images/book/image062.png\" title=\"\" width=\"307\" id=\"img_images_image062.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption7\">Jasmine.</span>\n</div><p>The extract of jasmine enters into the composition <a></a>of a great many of\nthe most approved handkerchief perfumes sold by the English and French\nperfumers.

It is prepared exactly as jasmine.

Commercially, however, it is disregarded, as from the\nsimilarity of odor to the oil distilled from the bitter almond, it is\nrarely, if ever, used by the perfumer, the latter being more economical.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Lavender</span>.—The climate of England appears to be better adapted\nfor the perfect development of this <a></a>fine old favorite perfume than any\nother on the globe. \"The ancients,\" says Burnett, \"employed the flowers\nand the leaves to aromatize their baths, and to give a sweet scent to\nwater in which they washed; hence the generic name of the plant,\n<i>Lavandula</i>.\"</p><p>Lavender is grown to an enormous extent at Mitcham, in Surrey, which is\nthe seat of its production, in a commercial point of view. Very large\nquantities are also grown in France, but the fine odor of the British\nproduce realizes in the market four times the price of that of\nContinental growth. Burnett says that the oil of <i>Lavandula spica</i> is\nmore pleasant than that derived from the other species, but this\nstatement must not mislead the purchaser to buy the French spike\nlavender, as it is not worth a tenth of that derived from the <i>Lavandulæ\nveræ</i>. Half-a-hundred weight of good lavender flowers yield, by\ndistillation, from 14 to 16 oz. of essential oil.</p><p>All the inferior descriptions of oil of lavender are used for perfuming\nsoaps and greases; but the best, that obtained from the Mitcham\nlavender, is entirely used in the manufacture of what is called lavender\nwater, but which, more properly, should be called essence or extract of\nlavender, to be in keeping with the nomenclature of other essences\nprepared with spirit.</p><p>The number of formulæ published for making a liquid perfume of lavender\nis almost endless, but the whole of them may be resolved into essence of\nlavender, simple; essence of lavender, compound; and lavender water.</p><p><a></a>There are two methods of making essence of lavender:—1. By distilling\na mixture of essential oil of lavender and rectified spirit; and the\nother—2. By merely mixing the oil and the spirit together.</p><p>The first process yields the finest quality: it is that which is adopted\nby the firm of Smyth and Nephew, whose reputation for this article is\nsuch that it gives a good character in foreign markets, especially\nIndia, to all products of lavender of English manufacture.

The otto of lemons\nin the market is principally from Messina, where there are hundreds of\nacres of \"lemon groves.\" Otto of lemons, like all the ottos of the\nCitrus family, is rapidly prone to oxidation when in contact with air\nand exposure to light; a high temperature is also detrimental, and as\nsuch is the case it should be preserved in a cool cellar. Most of the\nsamples from the gas-heated shelves of the druggists' shops, are as much\nlike essence of turpentine, to the smell, as that of lemons; rancid oil\nof lemons may, in a great measure, be purified <a></a>by agitation with warm\nwater and final decantation. When new and good, lemon otto may be freely\nused in combination with rosemary, cloves, and caraway, for perfuming\npowders for the nursery. From its rapid oxidation, it should not be used\nfor perfuming grease, as it assists rather than otherwise all fats to\nturn rancid; hence pomatums so perfumed will not keep well. In the\nmanufacture of other compound perfumes, it should be dissolved in\nspirit, in the proportion of six to eight ounces of oil to one gallon of\nspirit. There is a large consumption of otto of lemons in the\nmanufacture of Eau de Cologne; that Farina uses it is easily discovered\nby adding a few drops of Liq. Ammoniæ fort. to half an ounce of his Eau\nde Cologne, the smell of the lemon is thereby brought out in a\nremarkable manner.</p><p>Perhaps it is not out of place here to remark, that in attempts to\ndiscover the composition of certain perfumes, we are greatly assisted by\nthe use of strong Liq. Ammoniæ. Certain of the essential oils combining\nwith the Ammonia, allow those which do not do so, if present in the\ncompound, to be smelt.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Lemon Grass.</span>—According to Pereira, the otto in the market\nunder this name is derived from the <i>Andropogon schœnanthus</i> a\nspecies of grass which grows abundantly in India. It is cultivated to a\nlarge extent in Ceylon and in the Moluccas purposely for the otto, which\nfrom the plant is easily procured by distillation. Lemon grass otto, or,\nas it is sometimes called, oil of verbena, on account of its similarity\n<a></a>of odor to that favorite plant, is imported into this country in old\nEnglish porter and stout bottles. It is very powerful, well adapted for\nperfuming soaps and greases, but its principal consumption is in the\nmanufacture of artificial essence of verbena. From its comparatively low\nprice, great strength, and fine perfume (when diluted), the lemon grass\notto may be much more used than at present, with considerable advantage\nto the retail shopkeeper.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Lilac</span>.—The fragrance of the flowers of this ornamental shrub\nis well known. The essence of lilac is obtained either by the process of\nmaceration, or enfleurage with grease, and afterwards treating the\npomatum thus formed with rectified spirit, in the same manner as\npreviously described for cassie; the odor so much resembles tubereuse,\nas to be frequently used to adulterate the latter, the demand for\ntubereuse being at all times greater than the supply.

If lilies are thrown\ninto <a></a>oil of sweet almonds, or ben oil, they impart to it their sweet\nsmell; but to obtain anything like fragrance, the infusion must be\nrepeated a dozen times with the same oil, using fresh flowers for each\ninfusion, after standing a day or so.

To give\nit that sweetness which it appears to want, a <a></a>certain quantity of\nviolet is added to bring it up to the market odor.</p><p>As this plant is so very prolific in odor, we think something might be\ndone with it in England, especially as it flourishes as well in this\ncountry as in France; and we desire to see Flower Farms and organized\nPerfumatories established in the British Isles, for the extraction of\nessences and the manufacture of pomade and oils, of such flowers as are\nindigenous, or that thrive in the open fields of our country. Besides\nopening up a new field of enterprise and good investment for capital, it\nwould give healthy employment to many women and children.

A\nfew years ago real Indian shawls bore an extravagant price, and\npurchasers could always distinguish them by their odor; in fact, they\nwere perfumed with patchouly. The French manufacturers had for some time\nsuccessfully imitated the Indian fabric, but could not impart the odor.</p><p>At length they discovered the secret, and began to import the plant to\nperfume articles of their make, and thus palm off homespun shawls as\nreal Indian! From this origin the perfumers have brought it into use.\nPatchouly herb is extensively used for scenting drawers in which linen\nis kept; for this purpose it is best to powder the leaves and put them\ninto muslin sacks, covered with silk, after the manner of the\nold-fashioned <a></a>lavender-bag. In this state it is very efficacious in\npreventing the clothes from being attacked by moths. Several\ncombinations of patchouly will be given in the recipes for \"bouquets and\nnosegays.\"</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Pea</span> (<span class=\"smcap\">Sweet</span>).—A very fine odor may be abstracted from\nthe flowers of the chick-vetch by maceration in any fatty body, and then\ndigesting the pomade produced in spirit.

There is, as it were, an octave of odors like an\noctave in music; certain odors coincide, like the keys of an instrument.\nSuch as almond, heliotrope, vanilla, and orange-blossoms blend together,\neach producing different degrees of a nearly similar impression. Again,\nwe have citron, lemon, orange-peel, and verbena, forming a higher octave\nof smells, which blend in a similar manner. The metaphor is completed by\nwhat we are pleased to call semi-odors, such as rose and rose geranium\nfor the half note; petty grain, neroli, a black key, followed by fleur\nd'orange. Then we have patchouli, sandal-wood, and vitivert, and many\nothers running into each other.</p><p><a></a>From the odors already known we may produce, by uniting them in proper\nproportion, the smell of almost any flower, except jasmine.</p><p>The odor of some flowers resembles others so nearly that we are almost\ninduced to believe them to be the same thing, or, at least, if not\nevolved from the plant as such, to become so by the action of the\nair-oxidation. It is known that some actually are identical in\ncomposition, although produced from totally different plants, such as\ncamphor, turpentine, rosemary. Hence we may presume that chemistry will\nsooner or later produce one from the other, for with many it is merely\nan atom of water or an atom of oxygen that causes the difference. It\nwould be a grand thing to produce otto of roses from oil of rosemary, or\nfrom the rose geranium oil, and theory indicates its possibility.</p><p>The essential oil of almonds in a bottle that contains a good deal of\nair-oxygen, and but a very little of the oil, spontaneously passes into\nanother odoriferous body, benzoic acid; which is seen in crystals to\nform over the dry parts of the flask. This is a natural illustration of\nthis idea. In giving the recipe for \"sweet pea\" as above, we form it\nwith the impression that its odor resembles the orange-blossom, which\nsimilarity is approached nearer by the addition of the rose and\ntuberose.</p><p>The vanilla is used merely to give permanence to the scent on the\nhandkerchief, and this latter body is chosen in preference to extract of\nmusk or ambergris, which would answer the same purpose of giving\npermanence <a></a>to the more volatile ingredients; because the vanilla\nstrikes the same key of the olfactory nerve as the orange-blossom, and\nthus no new idea of a different scent is brought about as the perfume\ndies off from the handkerchief. When perfumes are not mixed upon this\nprinciple, then we hear that such and such a perfume becomes \"sickly\" or\n\"faint\" after they have been on the handkerchief a short time.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Pine-apple.</span>—Both Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Lyon Playfair have fallen\ninto some error in their inferences with regard to the application of\nthis odor in perfumery. After various practical experiments conducted in\na large perfumatory, we have come to the conclusion that it cannot be so\napplied, simply because when the essence of pine-apple is smelled at,\nthe vapor produces an involuntary action of the larynx, producing cough,\nwhen exceedingly dilute. Even in the infinitesimal portions it still\nproduces disagreeable irritation of the air-pipes, which, if prolonged,\nsuch as is expected if used upon a handkerchief, is followed by intense\nheadache. It is obvious, therefore, that the legitimate use of the\nessence of pine-apple (butyric ether) cannot be adapted with benefit to\nthe manufacturing perfumer, although invaluable to the confectioner as a\nflavoring material. What we have here said refers to the artificial\nessence of pine-apple, or butyrate of ethyloxide, which, if very much\ndiluted with alcohol, resembles the smell of pine-apple, and hence its\nname; but how far the same observations are applicable to the true\nessential oil from the fruit <a></a>or epidermis of the pine-apple, remains to\nbe seen <i>when</i> we procure it. As the West Indian pine-apples are now\ncoming freely into the market, the day is probably not distant when\ndemonstrative experiments can be tried; but hitherto it must be\nremembered our experiments have only been performed with a body\n<i>resembling in smell</i> the true essential oil of the fruit. The physical\naction of all ethers upon the human body is quite sufficient to prevent\ntheir application in perfumery, however useful in confectionary, which\nit is understood has to deal with another of the senses,—not of smell,\nbut of taste. The commercial \"essence of pine-apple,\" or \"pine-apple\noil,\" and \"jargonelle pear-oil,\" are admitted only to be <i>labelled</i>\nsuch, but really are certain organic acid ethers.

Very extensive rose farms exist at Adrianople\n(Turkey in Europe); at Broussa, now famous as the residence of\nAbd-el-Kader; and at Uslak (Turkey in Asia); also at Ghazepore, in\nIndia.</p><p>The cultivators in Turkey are principally the Christian inhabitants of\nthe low countries of the Balkan, between Selimno, and Carloya, as far as\nPhilippopolis, in Bulgaria, about 200 miles from Constantinople. In good\nseasons, this district yields 75,000 ounces; but in bad seasons only\n20,000 to 30,000 ounces of attar are obtained. It is estimated that it\nrequires at least 2000 rose blooms to yield one drachm of otto.</p><p>The otto slightly varies in odor from different districts; many places\nfurnish an otto which solidifies more readily than others, and,\ntherefore, this is not a sure guide of purity, though many consider it\nsuch. That which was exhibited in the Crystal Palace of 1851, as \"from\nGhazepore,\" in India, obtained the prize.</p><div class=\"blockquot\"><p>\"Attar of roses, made in Cashmere, is considered superior to any\nother; a circumstance not surprising, as, according to Hugel, the\nflower is here produced of surpassing fragrance as well as beauty.\nA large quantity of rose-water twice distilled is allowed to run\noff into an open vessel, placed over night in a cool running\nstream, and in the morning the oil is found floating on the\nsurface in minute specks, which are taken off very <a></a>carefully by\nmeans of a blade of sword-lily. When cool it is of a dark green\ncolor, and as hard as resin, not becoming liquid at a temperature\nabout that of boiling water. Between 500 and 600 pounds' weight of\nleaves is required to produce one ounce of the attar.\"—<i>Indian\nEncyclopædia.</i></p></div><p>Pure otto of roses, from its cloying sweetness, has not many admirers;\nwhen diluted, however, there is nothing to equal it in odor, especially\nif mixed in soap, to form rose soap, or in pure spirit, to form the\nesprit de rose. The soap not allowing the perfume to evaporate very\nfast, we cannot be surfeited with the smell of the otto.</p><p>The finest preparation of rose as an odor is made at Grasse, in France.\nHere the flowers are not treated for the otto, but are subjected to the\nprocess of maceration in fat, or in oil, as described under jasmine,\nheliotrope, &amp;c.</p><p>The rose pomade thus made, if digested in alcohol, say 8 lbs. of No. 24\nPomade to one gallon of spirit, yields an esprit de rose of the first\norder, very superior to that which is made by the addition of otto to\nspirit. It is difficult to account for this difference, but it is\nsufficiently characteristic to form a distinct odor. See the article on\nfleur d'orange and neroli (pp. 77, 78), which have similar qualities,\npreviously described. The esprit de rose made from the French rose\npomade is never sold retail by the perfumer; he reserves this to form\npart of his <i>recherche</i> bouquets.</p><p>Some wholesale druggists have, however, been selling it now for some\ntime to country practitioners, for them to form extemporaneous\nrose-water, which <a></a>it does to great perfection. Roses are cultivated to\na large extent in England, near Mitcham, in Surrey, for perfumers' use,\nto make rose-water. In the season when successive crops can be got,\nwhich is about the end of June, or the early part of July, they are\ngathered as soon as the dew is off, and sent to town in sacks. When they\narrive, they are immediately spread out upon a cool floor: otherwise, if\nleft in a heap, they heat to such an extent, in two or three hours, as\nto be quite spoiled. There is no organic matter which so rapidly absorbs\noxygen, and becomes heated spontaneously, as a mass of freshly gathered\nroses.</p><p>To preserve these roses, the London perfumers immediately pickle them;\nfor this purpose, the leaves are separated from the stalks, and to every\nbushel of flowers, equal to about six pounds' weight, one pound of\ncommon salt is thoroughly rubbed in. The salt absorbs the water existing\nin the petals, and rapidly becomes brine, reducing the whole to a pasty\nmass, which is finally stowed away in casks. In this way they will keep\nalmost any length of time, without the fragrance being seriously\ninjured. A good rose-water can be prepared by distilling 12 lbs. of\npickled roses, and 2-1/2 gallons of water. \"Draw\" off two gallons; the\nproduct will be the double-distilled rose-water of the shops. The\nrose-water that is imported from the South of France is, however, very\nsuperior in odor to any that can be produced here. As it is a residuary\nproduct of the distillation of roses for procuring the attar, it has a\nrichness of aroma which <a></a>appears to be inimitable with English-grown\nroses. There are four modifications of essence of rose for the\nhandkerchief, which are the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of the perfumer's art.

Now, when a\nperfume is made in a direct manner from any wood or herb, as tinctures\nare made, that is, by infusion in alcohol, there is obtained, besides\nthe odoriferous substance, a solution of coloring and extractive matter,\nwhich is exceedingly detrimental to its fragrance, besides seriously\nstaining any cambric handkerchief that it may be used upon; and for this\nreason this latter <a></a>method should never be adopted, except for use upon\nsilk handkerchiefs.</p><p>The odor of santal assimilates well with rose; and hence, prior to the\ncultivation of rose-leaf geranium, it was used to adulterate otto of\nroses; but is now but seldom used for that purpose.</p><p>By a \"phonetic\" error, santal is often printed \"sandal,\" and \"sandel.\"</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Sassafras.</span>—Some of the perfumers of Germany use a tincture of\nthe wood of the <i>Laurus sassafras</i> in the manufacture of hair-washes and\nother nostrums; but as, in our opinion, it has rather a \"physicky\" smell\nthan flowery, we cannot recommend the German recipes.

An ounce of\ntincture of storax, tolu, or benzoin, being added to a pound of any very\nvolatile perfume, gives a degree of permanence to it, and makes it last\nlonger on the handkerchief than it otherwise would: thus, when any\nperfume is made by the solution of an otto in spirit, it is usual to add\nto it a small portion of a substance which is less volatile, such as\nextract of musk, extract of vanilla, ambergris, storax, tolu, orris,\nvitivert, or benzoin; the manufacturer using his judgment and discretion\nas to which of <a></a>these materials are to be employed, choosing, of course,\nthose which are most compatible with the odor he is making.</p><p>The power which these bodies have of \"fixing\" a volatile substance,\nrenders them valuable to the perfumer, independent of their aroma, which\nis due in many cases to benzoic acid, slightly modified by an esential\noil peculiar to each substance, and which is taken up by the alcohol,\ntogether with a portion of resin. When the perfume is put upon a\nhandkerchief, the most volatile bodies disappear first: thus, after the\nalcohol has evaporated, the odor of the ottos appear stronger; if it\ncontains any resinous body, the ottos are held in solution, as it were,\nby the resin, and thus retained on the fabric. Supposing a perfume to be\nmade of otto only, without any \"fixing\" substance, then, as the perfume\n\"dies away,\" the olfactory nerve, if tutored, will detect its\ncomposition, for it spontaneously analyzes itself, no two ottos having\nthe same volatility: thus, make a mixture of rose, jasmine, and\npatchouly; the jasmine predominates first, then the rose, and, lastly,\nthe patchouly, which will be found hours after the others have\ndisappeared.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Syringa</span>.—The flowers of the <i>Philadelphus coronarius</i>, or\ncommon garden syringa, have an intense odor resembling the\norange-blossom; so much so, that in America the plant is often termed\n\"mock orange.\" A great deal of the pomatum sold as pommade surfin, à la\nfleur d'orange, by the manufacturers of Cannes, is nothing more than\nfine suet perfumed <a></a>with syringa blossoms by the maceration process.\nFine syringa pomade could be made in England at a quarter the cost of\nwhat is paid for the so-called orange pomatum.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Thyme.</span>—All the different species of thyme, but more\nparticularly the lemon thyme, the <i>Thymus serpyllum</i>, as well as the\nmarjorams, origanum, &amp;c., yield by distillation fragrant ottos, that are\nextensively used by manufacturing perfumers for scenting soaps; though\nwell adapted for this purpose, they do not answer at all in any other\ncombinations. Both in grease and in spirit all these ottos impart an\nherby smell (very naturally) rather than a flowery one, and, as a\nconsequence, they are not considered <i>recherché</i>.</p><p>When any of these herbs are dried and ground, they usefully enter into\nthe composition of sachet powders.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Tonquin</span>, or <span class=\"smcap\">Tonka</span>.—The seeds of the <i>Dipterix\nodorata</i> are the tonquin or <i>coumarouma</i> beans of commerce.

The violet farms from\nwhence the flowers are procured to make this perfume are very extensive\nat Nice and Grasse, also in the neighborhood of Florence. The true\nsmelling principle or otto of violets has never yet been isolated: a\nvery concentrated solution in alcohol impresses the olfactory nerve with\nthe idea of the presence of hydrocyanic acid, which is probably a true\nimpression. Burnett says that the plant <i>Viola tricolor</i> (heart's ease),\nwhen bruised, smells like peach kernels, and doubtless, therefore,\ncontains prussic acid.</p><p>The flowers of the heart's ease are scentless, but the plant evidently\ncontains a principle which in other species of the Viola, is eliminated\nas the<a></a> \"sweet that smells\" so beautifully alluded to by Shakspeare.</p><p>For commercial purposes, the odor of the violet is procured in\ncombination with spirit, oil, or suet, precisely according to the\nmethods previously described for obtaining the aroma of some other\nflowers before mentioned, such as those for cassie, jasmine,\norange-flower, namely, by maceration, or by <i>enfleurage</i>, the former\nmethod being principally adopted, followed by, when \"essence\" is\nrequired, digesting the pomade in rectified alcohol.</p><p>Good essence of violets, thus made, is of a beautiful green color, and,\nthough of a rich deep tint, has no power to stain a white fabric, and\nits odor is perfectly natural.</p><p>The essence of violet, as prepared for retail sale, is thus made,\naccording to the quality and strength of the pomade:—Take from six to\neight pounds of the violet pomade, chop it up fine, and place it into\none gallon of perfectly clean (free from fusel oil) rectified spirit,\nallow it to digest for three weeks or a month, then strain off the\nessence, and to every pint thereof add three ounces of tincture of orris\nroot, and three ounces of esprit de cassie; it is then fit for sale.</p><p>We have often seen displayed for sale in druggists' shops plain tincture\nof orris root, done up in nice bottles, with labels upon them inferring\nthe contents to be \"Extract of Violet;\" customers thus once \"taken in\"\nare not likely to be so a second time.</p><h4>A good <span class=\"smcap\">Imitation Essence of Violets</span> is best prepared thus—</h4><div class=\"center\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Spirituous extract of cassie pomade,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 pint.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Esprit de rose, from pomade,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2 \"</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Tincture of orris,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2 \"</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Spirituous extract of tuberose pomade,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/2 \"</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Otto of almonds,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">3 drops.</td></tr>\n</tbody></table></div><p>After filtration it is fit for bottling.

During the hot seasons an attendant sprinkles\nwater over them; this operation cools the apartment by the evaporation\nof the water, and, at the same time, perfumes the atmosphere, in a very\nagreeable manner, with the odoriferous principle of the vitivert. It has\na smell between the aromatic or spicy odor and that of flowers—if such\na distinction can be admitted. We classify it with orris root, not that\nit has any odor resembling it, but because it has a like effect in use\nin perfumery, and because it is prepared as a tincture for obtaining its\nodor.</p><p>About four pounds of the dried vitivert, as it is <a></a>imported, being cut\nsmall and set to steep in a gallon of rectified spirits for a fortnight,\nproduces the</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Essence of Vitivert</span> of the shops.
