export default `<h2><a id="SECTION_III"></a>SECTION III.</h2><p>Whenever a Still is named, or an article is said to be distilled or
"drawn," it must be understood to be done so by steam apparatus, as this
is the only mode which can be adopted for obtaining anything like a
delicate odor; the old plan of having the fire immediately under the
still, conveying an empyreumatic or burnt smell to the result, has
become obsolete in every well-regulated perfumatory.</p><p>The steam-still differs from the one described only in the lower part,
or pan, which is made double, so as to allow steam from a boiler to
circulate round the pan for the purpose of boiling the contents, instead
of the direct fire. In macerating, the heat is applied in the same way,
or by a contrivance like the common glue-pot, as made use of nowadays.</p><p>This description of apparatus will be found very useful for experiments
which we will suggest by-and-by.</p><p>The perfumes for the handkerchief, as found in the shops of Paris and
London, are either simple or compound; the former are called extracts,
<i>extraits</i>, <i>esprits</i>, or essences, and the latter <i>bouquets</i> and
nosegays, which are mixtures of the extracts so compounded in quantity
that no one flower or odor can be discovered as predominating over
another; and when made of the delicate-scented flowers carefully
blended, they produce an exquisite sensation on the <a id="Page_37"></a>olfactory nerve,
and are therefore much prized by all who can afford to purchase them.</p><p>We shall first explain the mode for obtaining the simple extracts of
flowers. This will be followed by the process for preparing ambergris,
musk, and civet, substances, which, though of animal origin, are of the
utmost importance as forming a large part in the most approved bouquets;
and we shall conclude this department of the art with recipes for all
the fashionable bouquets and nosegays, the value of which, we doubt not,
will be estimated according to the labor bestowed upon their analysis.</p><p>In order to render the work more easy of consultation, we have adopted
the alphabetical arrangement in preference to a more scientific
classification.</p><p>Among the collection of ottos of the East India Company at the
Exhibition of 1851, were several hitherto unknown in this country, and
possessing much interest.</p><p>It is to be regretted, that no person having any practical knowledge of
perfumery was placed on the jury of Class IV or XXIX. Had such been the
case, the desires of the exhibitors would probably have been realized,
and European perfumers benefited by the introduction of new odors from
the East. Some of the ottos sent by a native perfumer of Benares were
deemed worthy of honorable mention. Such as <i>Chumeylee</i>, <i>Beyla</i>,
<i>Begla</i>, <i>Moteya</i>, and many others from the Moluccas, but without any
information respecting them.</p><p>We are not going to speak of, perhaps, more than <a id="Page_38"></a>a tithe of the plants
that have a perfume—only those will be mentioned that are used by the
operative perfumer, and such as are imitated by him in consequence of
there being a demand for the article, which circumstances prevent him
from obtaining in its genuine state. The first that comes under our
notice is—</p><p><span class="smcap">Allspice.</span>—The odoriferous principle of allspice, commonly
called pimento, is obtained by distilling the dried fruit, before it is
quite ripe, of the <i>Eugenia pimenta</i> and <i>Myrtus pimenta</i> with water. It
is thus procured as an essential oil; it is but little used in
perfumery, and when so, only in combination with other spice oils; for
scenting soap it is, however, very agreeable, and much resembles the
smell of cloves, and deserves more attention than it has hitherto
received. Mixed in the proportion of two ounces of oil of allspice with
one gallon of rectified spirit of wine, it forms what may be termed
extract of allspice, which extract will be found very useful in the
manufacture of low-priced bouquets.</p><p><span class="smcap">Almonds.</span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div><p>This perfume has been much esteemed for many ages. It may be procured by
distilling the leaves of any of the laurel tribe, and the kernels of
stone fruit; for trade purposes, it is obtained from the <a id="Page_39"></a>bitter
almonds, and exists in the skin or pellicle that covers the seed after
it is shelled. In the ordinary way, the almonds are put into the press
for the purpose of obtaining the mild or fat oil from the nut; the cake
which is left after this process is then mixed with salt and water, and
allowed to remain together for about twenty-four hours prior to
distillation. The reason for moistening the cake is well understood to
the practical chemist, and although we are not treating the subject of
perfumery in a chemical sense, but only in a practical way, it may not
be inappropriate here to observe, that the essential oil of almonds does
not exist ready formed to any extent in the nut, but that it is produced
by a species of fermentation, from the amygdalin and emulsine contained
in the almonds, together with the water that is added. Analogous
substances exist in laurel leaves, and hence the same course is to be
pursued when they are distilled. Some manufacturers put the moistened
cake into a bag of coarse <a id="Page_40"></a>cloth, or spread it upon a sieve, and then
force the stream through it; in either case, the essential oil of the
almond rises with the watery vapor, and is condensed in the still-worm.
In this concentrated form, the odor of almonds is far from agreeable;
but when diluted with spirit, in the proportion of about one and a half
ounce of the oil to a gallon of spirit or alcohol, it is very pleasant.</p><p><a id="almond"></a></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption3">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption3">Almond.</span>
</div><p>The essential oil of almonds, enters into combination with soap, cold
cream, and many other materials prepared by the perfumer; for which see
their respective titles.</p><p>Fourteen pounds of the cake yield about one ounce of essential oil.</p><p>In experiments with this substance, it must be carefully remembered that
it is exceedingly <i>poisonous</i>, and, therefore, great caution is
necessary in its admixture with substances used as a cosmetic, otherwise
dangerous results may ensue.</p><p><i>Artificial Otto of Almonds.</i>—Five or six years ago, Mr. Mansfield, of
Weybridge, took out a patent for the manufacture of otto of almonds from
benzole. (Benzole is obtained from tar oil.) His apparatus, according to
the Report of the juries of the 1851 Exhibition, consists of a large
glass tube in the form of a coil, which at the upper end divides into
two tubes; each of which is provided with a funnel. A stream of nitric
acid flows slowly into one of the funnels, and benzole into the other.
The two substances meet at the point of union of the tubes, and a
combination ensues with the evolution of heat. As the <a id="Page_41"></a>newly formed
compound flows down through the coil it becomes cool, and is collected
at the lower extremity; it then requires to be washed with water, and
lastly with a dilute solution of carbonate of soda, to render it fit for
use. Nitro-benzole, which is the chemical name for this artificial otto
of almonds, has a different odor to the true otto of almonds, but it can
nevertheless be used for perfuming soap. Mr. Mansfield writes to me
under date of January 3d, 1855:—"In 1851, Messrs. Gosnell, of Three
King Court, began to make this perfume under my license; latterly I
withdrew the license from them by their consent, and since then it is
not made that I am aware of." It is, however, quite common in Paris.</p><p><span class="smcap">Anise.</span>—The odorous principle is procured by distilling the
seeds of the plant <i>Pimpinella anisum</i>; the product is the oil of
aniseed of commerce. As it congeals at a temperature of about 50° Fahr.,
it is frequently adulterated with a little spermaceti, to give a certain
solidity to it, whereby other cheaper essential oils can be added to it
with less chance of detection. As the oil of aniseed is quite soluble in
spirit, and the spermaceti insoluble, the fraud is easily detected.</p><p>This perfume is exceedingly strong, and is, therefore, well adapted for
mixing with soap and for scenting pomatums, but does not do nicely in
compounds for handkerchief use.</p><p><span class="smcap">Balm</span>, oil of Balm, called also oil of Melissa, is obtained by
distilling the leaves of the <i>Melissa officinalis</i> with water; it comes
from the still tap with the condensed <a id="Page_42"></a>steam or water, from which it is
separated with the tap funnel. But it is very little used in perfumery,
if we except its combination in <i>Aqua di Argento</i>.</p><p><span class="smcap">Balsam.</span>—Under this title there are two or three substances
used in perfumery, such as balsam of Peru, balsam of Tolu, and balsam of
storax (also called liquid amber). The first-named, is procured from the
<i>Myroxylon peruiferum</i>; it exudes from the tree when wounded, and is
also obtained by boiling down the bark and branches in water. The latter
is the most common method for procuring it. It has a strong odor, like
benzoin.</p><p>Balsam of Tolu flows from the <i>Toluifera balsammum</i>. It resembles common
resin (rosin); with the least warmth, however, it runs to a liquid, like
brown treacle. The smell of it is particularly agreeable, and being
soluble in alcohol makes a good basis for a bouquet, giving in this
respect a permanence of odor to a perfume which the simple solution of
an oil would not possess. For this purpose all these balsams are very
useful, though not so much used as they might be.</p><div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Ulex</span> has found that balsam of Tolu is frequently
adulterated with common resin. To detect this adulteration he
pours sulphuric acid on the balsam, and heats the mixture, when
the balsam dissolves to a cherry-red fluid, without evolving
sulphurous acid, but with the escape of benzoic or cinnamic acid,
if no common resin is present. On the contrary, the balsam foams,
blackens, and much sulphurous acid is set free, if it is
adulterated with common resin."—<i>Archives der Pharmacie</i>.</p></div><p>Balsam of storax, commonly called gum styrax, is obtained in the same
manner, and possessing similar <a id="Page_43"></a>properties, with a slight variation of
odor, is applicable in the same manner as the above.</p><p>They are all imported from South America, Chili, and Mexico, where the
trees that produce them are indigenous.</p><p><span class="smcap">Bay</span>, oil of sweet Bay, also termed essential oil of
laurel-berries, is a very fragrant substance, procured by distillation
from the berries of the bay laurel. Though very pleasant, it is not much
used.</p><p><span class="smcap">Bergamot.</span>—This most useful perfume is procured from the
<i>Citrus Bergamia</i>, by expression from the peel of the fruit. It has a
soft sweet odor, too well known to need description here. When new and
good it has a greenish-yellow tint, but loses its greenness by age,
especially if kept in imperfectly corked bottles. It then becomes cloudy
from the deposit of resinous matter, produced by the contact of the air,
and acquires a turpentine smell.</p><p>It is best preserved in well-stoppered bottles, kept in a cool cellar,
and in the dark; light, especially the direct sunshine, quickly
deteriorates its odor. This observation may be applied, indeed, to all
perfumes, except rose, which is not so spoiled.</p><p>When bergamot is mixed with other essential oils it greatly adds to
their richness, and gives a sweetness to spice oils attainable by no
other means, and such compounds are much used in the most highly scented
soaps. Mixed with rectified spirit in the proportions of about four
ounces of bergamot to a gallon, it forms what is called "extract of
bergamot," and in this state is used for the handkerchief. Though <a id="Page_44"></a>well
covered with extract of orris and other matters, it is the leading
ingredient in Bayley and Blew's Ess. Bouquet (see <span class="smcap">Bouquets</span>).</p><p><a id="styrax"></a></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 304px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption4">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption4">Styrax Benzoin.</span>
</div><p><span class="smcap">Benzoin</span>, also called Benjamin.—This is a very useful substance
to perfumers. It exudes from the <i>Styrax benzoin</i> by wounding the tree,
and drying, becomes a hard gum-resin. It is principally imported from
Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and Siam. The best kind comes from the latter
place, and used to be called Amygdaloides, because of its being
interspersed with several white spots, which resemble broken almonds.
When heated, these white specks rise as a smoke, which is easily
condensed upon paper. The material thus separated from the benzoin is
called flowers of benzoin in commerce, and by chemists is termed benzoic
acid. It has all, or nearly all, the odor of the resin from which it is
derived.</p><p>The extract, or tincture of benzoin, forms a good <a id="Page_45"></a>basis for a
bouquet.<a id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_B_2">[B]</a> Like balsam of Tolu, it gives permanence and body to a
perfume made with an essential oil in spirit.</p><p>The principal consumption of benzoin is in the manufacture of pastilles
(see <span class="smcap">Pastilles</span>), and for the preparation of fictitious vanilla
pomade (see <span class="smcap">Pomatums</span>).</p><p><span class="smcap">Caraway.</span>—This odoriferous principle is drawn by distillation
from the seeds of the <i>Carum carui</i>. It has a very pleasant smell, quite
familiar enough without description. It is well adapted to perfume soap,
for which it is much used in England, though rarely if ever on the
continent; when dissolved in spirit it may be used in combination with
oil of lavender and bergamot for the manufacture of cheap essences, in a
similar way to cloves (see <span class="smcap">Cloves</span>). If caraway seeds are
ground, they are well adapted for mixing to form sachet powder (see
<span class="smcap">Sachets</span>).</p><p><span class="smcap">Cascarilla.</span>—The bark is used in the formation of pastilles,
and also enters into the composition known as <i>Eau à Bruler</i>, for
perfuming apartments, to which we refer.</p><p>The bark alone of this plant is used by the manufacturing perfumer, and
that only in the fabrication of pastilles. The <i>Cascarilla gratissimus</i>
is however so fragrant, that according to Burnett its leaves are
gathered by the Koras of the Cape of Good Hope as a perfume, and both
the <i>C. fragrans</i> and <i>C. fragilis</i> are odoriferous. It behooves
perfumers, therefore, <a id="Page_46"></a>who are on the look out for novelties, to obtain
these leaves and ascertain the result of their distillation.</p><p>Messrs. Herring and Co., some years ago, drew the oil of cascarilla, but
it was only offered to the trade as a curiosity.</p><p><span class="smcap">Cassia.</span>—The essential oil of cassia is procured by distilling
the outer bark of the <i>Cinnamomum cassia</i>. 1 cwt. of bark yields rather
more than three quarters of a pound of oil; it has a pale yellow color;
in smell it much resembles cinnamon, although very inferior to it. It is
principally used for perfuming soap, especially what is called "military
soap," as it is more aromatic or spicy than flowery in odor; it
therefore finds no place for handkerchief use.</p><p><span class="smcap">Cassie.—</span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<img alt="Flower-buds of the Acacia Farnesiana." height="237" src="/static/images/book/image046.png" title="" width="524" id="img_images_image046.png">
<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption5">Flower-buds of the Acacia Farnesiana.</span>
</div><p>When smelled at alone, it has an intense violet odor, and is rather
sickly sweet.</p><p><a id="Page_47"></a>It is procured by maceration from the <i>Acacia farnesiana</i>. The purified
fat is melted, into which the flowers are thrown and left to digest for
several hours; the spent flowers are removed, and fresh are added, eight
or ten times, until sufficient richness of perfume is obtained. As many
flowers are used as the grease will cover, when they are put into it, in
a liquid state.</p><p>After being strained, and the pomade has been kept at a heat sufficient
only to retain its liquidity, all impurities will subside by standing
for a few days. Finally cooled, it is the cassie pomade of commerce. The
<i>Huile de Cassie</i>, or fat oil of cassie, is prepared in a similar
manner, substituting the oil of Egyptian ben nut, olive oil, or almond
oil, in place of suet. Both these preparations are obviously only a
solution of the true essential oil of cassie flowers in the neutral
fatty body. Europe may shortly be expecting to import a similar scented
pomade from South Australia, derived from the Wattle, a plant that
belongs to the same genus as the <i>A. farnesiana</i>, and which grows most
luxuriantly in Australia. Mutton fat being cheap, and the wattle
plentiful, a profitable trade may be anticipated in curing the flowers,
&amp;c.</p><p>To prepare the extract of cassie, take six pounds of No. 24 (best
quality) cassie pomade, and place upon it one gallon of the best
rectified spirit, as sent out by Bowerbank, of Bishopsgate. After it has
digested for three weeks or a month, at a summer heat, it is fit to draw
from the pomatum, and, if good, has a beautiful green color and rich
flowery <a id="Page_48"></a>smell of the cassie blossom. All extracts made by this
process—<i>maceration</i>, or, as it may be called, cold <i>infusion</i>, give a
more natural smell of the flowers to the result, than by merely
dissolving the essential oil (procured by distillation) in the spirit;
moreover, where the odor of the flower exists in only very minute
quantities, as in the present instance, and with violet, jasmine, &amp;c.,
it is the only practical mode of proceeding.</p><p>In this, and all other similar cases, the pomatum must be cut up into
very small pieces, after the domestic manner of "chopping suet," prior
to its being infused in the alcohol. The action of the mixture is simply
a change of place in the odoriferous matter, which leaves the fat body
by the superior attraction, or affinity, as the chemists say, of the
spirits of wine, in which it freely dissolves.</p><p>The major part of the extract can be poured or drawn off the pomatum
without trouble, but it still retains a portion in the interstices,
which requires time to drain away, and this must be assisted by placing
the pomatum in a large funnel, supported by a bottle, in order to
collect the remainder. Finally, all the pomatum, which is now called
<i>washed pomatum</i>, is to be put into a tin, which tin must be set into
hot water, for the purpose of melting its contents; when the pomatum
thus becomes liquefied, any extract that is still in it rises to the
surface, and can be skimmed off, or when the pomatum becomes cold it can
be poured from it.</p><p>The washed pomatum is preserved for use in the <a id="Page_49"></a>manufacture of dressing
for the hair, for which purpose it is exceedingly well adapted, on
account of the purity of the grease from which it was originally
prepared, but more particularly on account of a certain portion of odor
which it still retains; and were it not used up in this way, it would be
advisable to put it for a second infusion in spirit, and thus a weaker
extract could be made serviceable for lower priced articles.</p><p>I cannot leave cassie without recommending it more especially to the
notice of perfumers and druggists, as an article well adapted for the
purpose of the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief and pomades
for the hair. When diluted with other odors, it imparts to the whole
such a true flowery fragrance, that it is the admiration of all who
smell it, and has not a little contributed to the great sale which
certain proprietary articles have attained.</p><p>We caution the inexperienced not to confound cassie with cassia, which
has a totally different odor. See <span class="smcap">Acacia Pomade</span>.</p><p><span class="smcap">Cedar Wood</span> now and then finds a place in a perfumer's
warehouse; when ground, it does well to form a body for sachet powder.
Slips of cedar wood are sold as matches for lighting lamps, because
while burning an agreeable odor is evolved; some people use it also, in
this condition, distributed among clothes in drawers to "prevent moth."
On distillation it yields an essential oil that is exceedingly fragrant.</p><p>Messrs. Rigge and Co., of London, use it extensively for scenting soap.</p><h4><span class="smcap"><a id="Page_50"></a>Lebanon Cedar Wood</span>. (<i>For the Handkerchief.</i>)</h4><div class="center">

made. Its crimson color, however, prohibits it from being used for the
handkerchief. It forms an excellent tincture for the teeth, and is the
basis of the celebrated French dentifrice "eau Botot."</p><p><span class="smcap">Cedrat</span>.—This perfume is procured from the rind of the citron
fruit (<i>Citrus medica</i>), both by distillation and expression; it has a
very beautiful lemony odor, and is much admired. It is principally used
in the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief, being too expensive
for perfuming grease or soap. What is called extract of cedrat is made
by dissolving two ounces of the above essential oil of citron in one
pint of spirits, to which some perfumers add half an ounce of bergamot.</p><p><span class="smcap">Cinnamon</span>.—Several species of the plant <i>Laurus cinnamomum</i>
yield the cinnamon and cassia of commerce. Its name is said to be
derived from <i>China Amomum</i>, the bark being one of the most valued
spices of the East. Perfumers use both the bark and the oil, which is
obtained by distillation from it. The ground bark enters into the
composition of some pastilles, tooth powders, and sachets. The essential
oil of cinnamon is principally brought to this country from Ceylon; it
is exceedingly powerful, and must <a id="Page_51"></a>be used sparingly. In such compounds
as cloves answer, so will cinnamon.</p><p><span class="smcap">Citron</span>.—On distilling the flowers of the <i>Citrus medica</i>, a
very fragrant oil is procured, which is a species of neroli, and is
principally consumed by the manufacturers of eau de Cologne.</p><p><span class="smcap">Citronella</span>.—Under this name there is an oil in the market,
chiefly derived from Ceylon and the East Indies; its true origin we are
unable to decide; in odor it somewhat resembles citron fruit, but is
very inferior. Probably it is procured from one of the grasses of the
<i>Andropogon</i> genus. Being cheap, it is extensively used for perfuming
soap. What is now extensively sold as "honey" soap, is a fine yellow
soap slightly perfumed with this oil. Some few use it for scenting
grease, but it is not much admired in that way.</p><p><span class="smcap">Cloves</span>.—Every part of the clove plant (<i>Caryophyllus
aromaticus</i>) abounds with aromatic oil, but it is most fragrant and
plentiful in the unexpanded <a id="Page_52"></a>flower-bud, which are the cloves of
commerce. Cloves have been brought into the European market for more
than 2000 years. The plant is a native of the Moluccas and other islands
in the China seas. "The average annual crop of cloves," says Burnett,
"is, from each tree, 2 or 2-1/2 lbs., but a fine tree has been known to
yield 125 lbs. of this spice in a single season, and as 5000 cloves only
weigh one pound, there must have been at least 625,000 flowers upon this
single tree."</p><p><a id="Clove"></a></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption6">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption6">Clove.</span>
</div><p>The oil of cloves may be obtained by expression from the fresh
flower-buds, but the usual method of procuring it is by distillation,
which is carried on to a very great extent in this country. Few
essential oils have a more extensive use in perfumery than that of
cloves; it combines well with grease, soap, and spirit, and, as will be
seen in the recipes for the various bouquets given hereafter, it forms a
leading feature in some of the most popular handkerchief essences,
Rondeletia, the Guard's Bouquet, &amp;c., and will be found where least
expected. For essence of cloves, dissolve oil of cloves in the
proportion of two ounces of oil to one gallon of spirit.</p><p><span class="smcap">Dill</span>.—Perfumers are now and then asked for "dill water;" it
is, however, more a druggist's article than a perfumer's, as it is more
used for its medicinal qualities than for its odor, which by the way, is
rather pleasant than otherwise. Some ladies use a mixture of half dill
water and half rose water, as a simple cosmetic, "to clear the
complexion."</p><p>The oil of dill is procured by submitting the <a id="Page_53"></a>crushed fruit of dill
(<i>Anethum graveolens</i>) with water to distillation. The oil floats on the
surface of the distillate, from which it is separated by the funnel in
the usual manner; after the separation of the oil, the "water" is fit
for sale. Oil of dill may be used with advantage, if in small
proportions, and mixed with other oils, for perfuming soap.</p><p><span class="smcap">Eglantine</span>, or <span class="smcap">Sweet Briar</span>, notwithstanding what the
poet Robert Noyes says—</p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

This, like many other sweet-scented plants, does not repay the labor of
collecting its odor. The fragrant part of this plant is destroyed more
or less under every treatment that it is put to, and hence it is
discarded. As, however, the article is in demand by the public, a
species of fraud is practised upon them, by imitating it thus:—</p><h4> <span class="smcap">Imitation Eglantine, or Essence of Sweet Briar.</span></h4><div class="center">

for its odorous quality used by the perfumer, is elder-flower water. To

introduce it to the still with four gallons of water; the first three
gallons that come over is all that need be preserved for use; one ounce
of rectified spirit should be added to each gallon of "water" distilled,
and when bottled it is ready for sale. Other preparations of elder
flowers are made, such as milk of elder, extract of elder, &amp;c., which
will be found in their proper place under Cosmetics. Two or three new

likely to meet with a very large sale on account of the reputed cooling
qualities of the ingredients; of these we would call attention more
particularly to cold cream of elder-flowers, and to elder oil for the
hair.</p><p>The preparations of elder-flowers, if made according to the
Pharmacopœias, are perfectly useless, as the forms therein given show
an utter want of knowledge of the properties of the materials employed.</p><p><span class="smcap">Fennel</span> (<i>Fœniculum vulgare</i>).—Dried fennel herb, when
ground, enters into the composition of some sachet powders. The oil of
fennel, in conjunction with other aromatic oils, may be used for
perfuming soap. It is procurable by distillation.</p><p><span class="smcap">Flag</span> (<span class="smcap">Sweet</span>) (<i>Acorus calamus</i>).—The roots, or
rhizome, of the sweet flag, yield by distillation a pleasant-smelling
oil; 1 cwt. of the rhizome will thus yield one pound of oil. It can be
used according to the pleasure of the manufacturer in scenting grease,
soap, or for extracts, but requires other sweet oils with it to hide its
origin.</p><p><span class="smcap"><a id="Page_55"></a>Geranium</span> (<i>Pelargonium odoratissimum</i>, rose-leaf
geranium).—The leaves of this plant yield by distillation a very
agreeable rosy-smelling oil, so much resembling real otto of rose, that
it is used very extensively for the adulteration of that valuable oil,
and is grown very largely for that express purpose. It is principally
cultivated in the south of France, and in Turkey (by the rose-growers).
In the department of Seine-et-Oise, at Montfort-Lamaury, in France,
hundreds of acres of it may be seen growing. 1 cwt. of leaves will yield
about two ounces of essential oil. Used to adulterate otto of rose, it
is in its turn itself adulterated with ginger grass oil (<i>Andropogon</i>),
and thus formerly was very difficult to procure genuine; on account of
the increased cultivation of the plant, it is now, however, easily
procured pure. Some samples are greenish-colored, others nearly white,
but we prefer that of a brownish tint.</p><p>When dissolved in rectified spirit, in the proportion of about six
ounces to the gallon, it forms the "extract of rose-leaf geranium" of
the shops. A word or two is necessary about the oil of geranium, as much
confusion is created respecting it, in consequence of there being an oil
under the name of geranium, but which in reality is derived from the
<i>Andropogon nardus</i>, cultivated in the Moluccas. This said andropogon
(geranium!) oil can be used to adulterate the true geranium, and hence
we suppose its nomenclature in the drug markets. The genuine rose-leaf
geranium oil fetches about 6<i>s.</i> per ounce, while the andropogon oil is
not worth more than that <a id="Page_56"></a>sum per pound. And we may observe here, that
the perfuming essential oils are best purchased through the wholesale
perfumers, as from the nature of their trade they have a better
knowledge and means of obtaining the real article than the drug-broker.
On account of the pleasing odor of the true oil of rose-leaf geranium,
it is a valuable article for perfuming many materials, and appears to
give the public great satisfaction.</p><p><span class="smcap">Heliotrope.</span>—Either by maceration or enfleurage with clarified
fat, we may obtain this fine odor from the flowers of the <i>Heliotrope
Peruvianum</i> or <i>H. grandiflorum</i>. Exquisite as the odor of this plant
is, at present it is not applied to use by the manufacturing perfumer.
This we think rather a singular fact, especially as the perfume is
powerful and the flowers abundant. We should like to hear of some
experiments being tried with this plant for procuring its odor in this
country, and for that purpose now suggest the mode of operation which
would most likely lead to successful results. For a small trial in the
first instance, which can be managed by any person having the run of a
garden, we will say, procure an ordinary glue-pot now in common use,
which melts the material by the boiling of water; it is in fact a
water-bath, in chemical parlance—one capable of holding a pound or more
of melted fat. At the season when the flowers are in bloom, obtain half
a pound of fine mutton suet, melt the suet and strain it through a close
hair-sieve, allow the liquefied fat, as it falls from the sieve, to drop
into cold spring water; <a id="Page_57"></a>this operation granulates and washes the blood
and membrane from it. In order to start with a perfectly inodorous
grease, the melting and granulation process may be repeated three or
four times; finally, remelt the fat and cast it into a pan to free it
from adhering water.</p><p>Now put the clarified suet into the macerating pot, and place it in such
a position near the fire of the greenhouse, or elsewhere that will keep
it warm enough to be liquid; into the fat throw as many flowers as you
can, and there let them remain for twenty-four hours; at this time
strain the fat from the spent flowers and add fresh ones; repeat this
operation for a week: we expect at the last straining the fat will have
become very highly perfumed, and when cold may be justly termed <i>Pomade
à la Heliotrope</i>.</p><p>The cold pomade being chopped up, like suet for a pudding, is now to be
put into a wide-mouthed bottle, and covered with spirits as highly
rectified as can be obtained, and left to digest for a week or more; the
spirit then strained off will be highly perfumed; in reality it will be
<i>extract of Heliotrope</i>, a delightful perfume for the handkerchief. The
rationale of the operation is simple enough: the fat body has a strong
affinity or attraction for the odorous body, or essential oil of the
flowers, and it therefore absorbs it by contact, and becomes itself
perfumed. In the second operation, the spirit has a much greater
attraction for the fragrant principle than the fatty matter; the former,
therefore, becomes perfumed at the expense <a id="Page_58"></a>of the latter. The same
experiment may be repeated with almond oil substituted for the fat.</p><p>The experiment here hinted at, may be varied with any flowers that there
are to spare; indeed, by having the macerating bath larger than was
mentioned above, an excellent <i>millefleur</i> pomade and essence might be
produced from every conservatory in the kingdom, and thus we may receive
another enjoyment from the cultivation of flowers beyond their beauty of
form and color.</p><p>We hope that those of our readers who feel inclined to try experiments
of this nature will not be deterred by saying, "they are not worth the
trouble." It must be remembered, that very fine essences realize in the
London perfumery warehouses 16<i>s.</i> per pint of 16 ounces, and that fine
<i>flowery-scented</i> pomades fetch the same sum per pound. If the
experiments are successful they should be published, as then we may hope
to establish a new and important manufacture in this country. But we are
digressing.</p><p>The odor of heliotrope resembles a mixture of almonds and vanilla, and

<span class="i8">"Luxuriant above all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The jasmine throwing wide her elegant sweets."<br></span>
</div></div><p>This flower is one of the most prized by the perfumer. Its odor is
delicate and sweet, and so peculiar that it is without comparison, and
as such cannot be imitated. When the flowers of the <i>Jasminum
odoratissimum</i><a id="Page_61"></a> are distilled, repeatedly using the water of
distillation over fresh flowers, the essential oil of jasmine may be
procured. It is, however, exceedingly rare, on account of the enormous
cost of production. There was a fine sample of six ounces exhibited in
the Tunisian department of the Crystal Palace, the price of which was
9<i>l.</i> the fluid ounce! The plant is the Yasmyn of the Arabs, from which
our name is derived.</p><p>In the perfumer's laboratory, the method of obtaining the odor is by
absorption, or, as the French term it, <i>enfleurage</i>; that is, by
spreading a mixture of pure lard and suet on a glass tray, and sticking
the fresh-gathered flowers all over it, leaving them to stand a day or
so, and repeating the operation with fresh flowers—the grease absorbs
the odor. Finally, the pomade is scraped off the glass or slate, melted
at as low a temperature as possible, and strained.</p><p>Oils strongly impregnated with the fragrance are also prepared much in
the same way. Layers of cotton wool, previously steeped in oil of ben
(obtained by pressure from the blanched nuts of the <i>Moringa oleifera</i>)
are covered with jasmine flowers, which is repeated several times;
finally, the cotton or linen cloths which some perfumers use, are
squeezed under a press. The jasmine oil thus produced is the <i>Huile
antique au jasmin</i> of the French houses.</p><p>The "extract of jasmine" is prepared by pouring rectified spirit on the
jasmine pomade or oil, and allowing them to remain together for a
fortnight at a summer heat. The best quality extract requires two
<a id="Page_62"></a>pounds of pomatum to every quart of spirit. The same can be done with
the oil of jasmine. If the pomade is used, it must be cut up fine
previously to being put into the spirit; if the oil is used, it must be
shaken well together every two or more hours, otherwise, on account of
its specific gravity, the oil separates, and but little surface is
exposed to the spirit. After the extract is strained off, the "washed"
pomatum or oil is still useful, if remelted, in the composition of
pomatum for the hair, and gives more satisfaction to a customer than any
of the "creams and balms," &amp;c. &amp;c., made up and scented with essential
oils; the one smells of the flower, the other "a nondescript."</p><p><a id="jasmine"></a></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 307px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption7">

</div><p>The extract of jasmine enters into the composition <a id="Page_63"></a>of a great many of

nobilis</i>, and from the leaves of the <i>Laurus cerasus</i>, an oil and
perfumed water are procurable of a very beautiful and fragrant
character. Commercially, however, it is disregarded, as from the
similarity of odor to the oil distilled from the bitter almond, it is
rarely, if ever, used by the perfumer, the latter being more economical.</p><p><span class="smcap">Lavender</span>.—The climate of England appears to be better adapted
for the perfect development of this <a id="Page_64"></a>fine old favorite perfume than any
other on the globe. "The ancients," says Burnett, "employed the flowers
and the leaves to aromatize their baths, and to give a sweet scent to
water in which they washed; hence the generic name of the plant,
<i>Lavandula</i>."</p><p>Lavender is grown to an enormous extent at Mitcham, in Surrey, which is
the seat of its production, in a commercial point of view. Very large
quantities are also grown in France, but the fine odor of the British
produce realizes in the market four times the price of that of
Continental growth. Burnett says that the oil of <i>Lavandula spica</i> is
more pleasant than that derived from the other species, but this
statement must not mislead the purchaser to buy the French spike
lavender, as it is not worth a tenth of that derived from the <i>Lavandulæ
veræ</i>. Half-a-hundred weight of good lavender flowers yield, by
distillation, from 14 to 16 oz. of essential oil.</p><p>All the inferior descriptions of oil of lavender are used for perfuming
soaps and greases; but the best, that obtained from the Mitcham
lavender, is entirely used in the manufacture of what is called lavender
water, but which, more properly, should be called essence or extract of
lavender, to be in keeping with the nomenclature of other essences
prepared with spirit.</p><p>The number of formulæ published for making a liquid perfume of lavender
is almost endless, but the whole of them may be resolved into essence of
lavender, simple; essence of lavender, compound; and lavender water.</p><p><a id="Page_65"></a>There are two methods of making essence of lavender:—1. By distilling
a mixture of essential oil of lavender and rectified spirit; and the
other—2. By merely mixing the oil and the spirit together.</p><p>The first process yields the finest quality: it is that which is adopted
by the firm of Smyth and Nephew, whose reputation for this article is
such that it gives a good character in foreign markets, especially
India, to all products of lavender of English manufacture. Lavender
essence, that which is made by the still, is quite white, while that by
mixture only always has a yellowish tint, which by age becomes darker
and resinous.</p><h4> <span class="smcap">Smyth's Lavender.</span></h4><p>To produce a very fine distillate, take—</p><div class="center">

simple essences.</p><p><span class="smcap">Lemon.</span>—This fine perfume is abstracted from the <i>Citrus
limonum</i>, by expression, from the rind of the fruit. The otto of lemons
in the market is principally from Messina, where there are hundreds of
acres of "lemon groves." Otto of lemons, like all the ottos of the
Citrus family, is rapidly prone to oxidation when in contact with air
and exposure to light; a high temperature is also detrimental, and as
such is the case it should be preserved in a cool cellar. Most of the
samples from the gas-heated shelves of the druggists' shops, are as much
like essence of turpentine, to the smell, as that of lemons; rancid oil
of lemons may, in a great measure, be purified <a id="Page_67"></a>by agitation with warm
water and final decantation. When new and good, lemon otto may be freely
used in combination with rosemary, cloves, and caraway, for perfuming
powders for the nursery. From its rapid oxidation, it should not be used
for perfuming grease, as it assists rather than otherwise all fats to
turn rancid; hence pomatums so perfumed will not keep well. In the
manufacture of other compound perfumes, it should be dissolved in
spirit, in the proportion of six to eight ounces of oil to one gallon of
spirit. There is a large consumption of otto of lemons in the
manufacture of Eau de Cologne; that Farina uses it is easily discovered
by adding a few drops of Liq. Ammoniæ fort. to half an ounce of his Eau
de Cologne, the smell of the lemon is thereby brought out in a
remarkable manner.</p><p>Perhaps it is not out of place here to remark, that in attempts to
discover the composition of certain perfumes, we are greatly assisted by
the use of strong Liq. Ammoniæ. Certain of the essential oils combining
with the Ammonia, allow those which do not do so, if present in the
compound, to be smelt.</p><p><span class="smcap">Lemon Grass.</span>—According to Pereira, the otto in the market
under this name is derived from the <i>Andropogon schœnanthus</i> a
species of grass which grows abundantly in India. It is cultivated to a
large extent in Ceylon and in the Moluccas purposely for the otto, which
from the plant is easily procured by distillation. Lemon grass otto, or,
as it is sometimes called, oil of verbena, on account of its similarity
<a id="Page_68"></a>of odor to that favorite plant, is imported into this country in old
English porter and stout bottles. It is very powerful, well adapted for
perfuming soaps and greases, but its principal consumption is in the
manufacture of artificial essence of verbena. From its comparatively low
price, great strength, and fine perfume (when diluted), the lemon grass
otto may be much more used than at present, with considerable advantage
to the retail shopkeeper.</p><p><span class="smcap">Lilac</span>.—The fragrance of the flowers of this ornamental shrub
is well known. The essence of lilac is obtained either by the process of
maceration, or enfleurage with grease, and afterwards treating the
pomatum thus formed with rectified spirit, in the same manner as
previously described for cassie; the odor so much resembles tubereuse,
as to be frequently used to adulterate the latter, the demand for
tubereuse being at all times greater than the supply. A beautiful

smell; but to obtain anything like fragrance, the infusion must be
repeated a dozen times with the same oil, using fresh flowers for each

quantity of spirit for a week, gives up its odor to the alcohol, and

commonly called oil of oringeat by the French, is exceedingly powerful,
and in this respect resembles all the ottos from the different species
of thyme, of which the marjoram is one. One hundred weight of the dry
herb yields about ten ounces of the otto. Oringeat oil is extensively
used for perfuming soap, but more in France than in England. It is the
chief ingredient used by Gelle Frères, of Paris, for scenting their

it would scarcely be known otherwise than as a weed. Sweet as it is in
its natural state, and prolific in odor, we are not able to maintain its
characteristic smell as an essence. Like many others, during separation
from the plant, the fragrance is more or less modified; though not
perfect, it still reminds the sense of the odor of the flowers. To give
it that sweetness which it appears to want, a <a id="Page_71"></a>certain quantity of
violet is added to bring it up to the market odor.</p><p>As this plant is so very prolific in odor, we think something might be
done with it in England, especially as it flourishes as well in this
country as in France; and we desire to see Flower Farms and organized
Perfumatories established in the British Isles, for the extraction of
essences and the manufacture of pomade and oils, of such flowers as are
indigenous, or that thrive in the open fields of our country. Besides
opening up a new field of enterprise and good investment for capital, it
would give healthy employment to many women and children. Open air
employment for the young is of no little consideration to maintain the
stamina of the future generation; for it cannot be denied that our
factory system and confined cities are prejudicial to the physical
condition of the human family.</p><p>To return from our digression. The essence of mignonette, or, as it is
more often sold under the name of Extrait de Rézéda, is prepared by
infusing the rézéda pomade in rectified spirit, in the proportion of one
pound of pomade to one pint of spirit, allowing them to digest together
for a fortnight, when the essence is filtered off the pomade. One ounce
of extrait d'ambré is added to every pint. This is done to give
permanence to the odor upon the handkerchief, and does not in any way
alter its odor.</p><p><span class="smcap">Miribane.</span>—The French name for artificial essence of almond

from the orange-blossom, varying according to the methods adopted for
procuring them. This difference of perfume from the same flower is a
great advantage to the manufacturer. This curious fact is worthy of
inquiry by the chemical philosopher. It is not peculiar to the
orange-flower, but applies to many others, especially rose—probably to
all flowers.</p><p>When orange-flowers are treated by the maceration process, that is, by
infusion in a fatty body, we procure orange-flower pomatum, its strength
and quality being regulated by the number of infusions of the flower
made in the same grease.</p><p>By digesting this orange-flower pomatum in rectified spirits in the
proportions of from six pounds to eight pounds of pomade to a gallon of
spirit, for about a fortnight at a summer heat, we obtain the extrait de
fleur d'orange, or extract of orange-flowers, a handkerchief perfume
surpassed by none. In this state its odor resembles the original so
much, that with closed eyes the best judge could not distinguish the
scent of the extract from that of the flower. The peculiar <a id="Page_74"></a>flowery odor
of this extract renders it valuable to perfumers, not only to sell in a
pure state, but slightly modified with other <i>extraits</i> passes for
"sweet pea," "magnolia," &amp;c., which it slightly resembles in fragrance.</p><p><a id="Orange"></a></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 305px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption8">

</div><p>Now, when orange-flowers are distilled with water, we procure the otto
of the blossom, which is known commercially as oil of neroli. The neroli
procured from the flowers of the Citrus aurantium is considered to be
the finest quality, and is called "neroli petale." The next quality,
"neroli bigarade," is derived from the blossoms of the <i>Citrus
bigaradia</i>, or Seville orange. Another quality, which is considered
inferior to the preceding, is the neroli petit grain, <a id="Page_75"></a>obtained by
distilling the leaves and the young unripe fruit of the different
species of the citrus.</p><p>The "petale" and "bigarade" neroli are used to an enormous extent in the
manufacture of eau de Cologne and other handkerchief perfumes. The petit
grain is mainly consumed for scenting soap. To form the esprit de
neroli, dissolve 1-1/2 oz. of neroli petale in one gallon of rectified
spirits. Although very agreeable, and extensively used in the
manufacture of bouquets, it has no relation to the flowery odor of the
extrait de fleur d'orange, as derived from the same flowers by
maceration; in fact, it has as different an odor as though obtained from
another plant, yet in theory both these <i>extraits</i> are but alcoholic
solutions of the otto of the flower.</p><p>The water used for distillation in procuring the neroli, when well freed
from the oil, is imported into this country under the name of eau de
fleur d'orange, and may be used, like elder-flower and rose-water, for
the skin, and as an eye lotion. It is remarkable for its fine fragrance,
and it is astonishing that it is not more used, being moderate in price.

Though an otto can be drawn from them of a very fragrant character, it

bags.—See "Sachet's Powders."</p><p><span class="smcap">Olibanum</span> is a gum resin, used to a limited extent in this

probably owes its perfume to a peculiar odoriferous body, associated
with the benzoic acid it contains.</p><p>For making the tincture or extract of olibanum, take 1 pound of the gum

exceedingly derogatory to the charming aroma of that modest flower when
such invidious comparisons are made. Nevertheless <a id="Page_78"></a>the perfume of iris
root is good, and well worthy of the place it has obtained as a
perfuming substance. The powder of orris root is very extensively used
in the manufacture of sachet powders, tooth-powder, &amp;c. It fathers that

take off. It requires considerable time to drain away, and, to prevent
loss, the remainder of the orris should be placed in the tincture press.
This extract enters into the composition of many of the most celebrated
bouquets, such as "Jockey Club," and others, but is never sold alone,
because its odor, although grateful, is not sufficiently good to stand
public opinion upon its own merits; but in combination its value is very
great; possessing little aroma itself, yet it has the power of
strengthening the odor of other fragrant bodies; like the flint and
steel, which though comparatively incombustible, readily fire
inflammable bodies.</p><p><span class="smcap">Palm.</span>—The odor of palm oil—the fat oil of commerce—is due to
a fragrant principle which it contains. By infusion in alcohol, the
odoriferous body is dissolved, and resembles, to a certain extent, the

is not likely to be brought into use, <a id="Page_79"></a>though several attempts have been
made to render it of service when the cultivation of the violets have

<i>Plectranthus crassifolius</i> (<span class="smcap">Burnett</span>), is an herb that grows

yield about 28 oz. of the essential oil, which is of a dark brown color,

resembles in its physical character. Its odor is the most powerful of
any derived from the botanic kingdom; hence, if mixed in <a id="Page_80"></a>the proportion

</tbody></table></div><p>The essence of patchouly thus made is that which is found in the
perfumers' shops of Paris and London. Although few perfumes have had
such a fashionable run, yet when smelled at in its pure state, it is far
from agreeable, having a kind of mossy or musty odor, analogous to
Lycopodium, or, as some say, it smells of "old coats."</p><p>The characteristic smell of Chinese or Indian ink is due to some
admixture of this herb.</p><p>The origin of the use of patchouly as a perfume in Europe is curious. A
few years ago real Indian shawls bore an extravagant price, and
purchasers could always distinguish them by their odor; in fact, they
were perfumed with patchouly. The French manufacturers had for some time
successfully imitated the Indian fabric, but could not impart the odor.</p><p>At length they discovered the secret, and began to import the plant to
perfume articles of their make, and thus palm off homespun shawls as
real Indian! From this origin the perfumers have brought it into use.
Patchouly herb is extensively used for scenting drawers in which linen
is kept; for this purpose it is best to powder the leaves and put them
into muslin sacks, covered with silk, after the manner of the
old-fashioned <a id="Page_81"></a>lavender-bag. In this state it is very efficacious in
preventing the clothes from being attacked by moths. Several
combinations of patchouly will be given in the recipes for "bouquets and
nosegays."</p><p><span class="smcap">Pea</span> (<span class="smcap">Sweet</span>).—A very fine odor may be abstracted from

</tbody></table></div><p>Scents, like sounds, appear to influence the olfactory nerve in certain
definite degrees. There is, as it were, an octave of odors like an
octave in music; certain odors coincide, like the keys of an instrument.
Such as almond, heliotrope, vanilla, and orange-blossoms blend together,
each producing different degrees of a nearly similar impression. Again,
we have citron, lemon, orange-peel, and verbena, forming a higher octave
of smells, which blend in a similar manner. The metaphor is completed by
what we are pleased to call semi-odors, such as rose and rose geranium
for the half note; petty grain, neroli, a black key, followed by fleur
d'orange. Then we have patchouli, sandal-wood, and vitivert, and many
others running into each other.</p><p><a id="Page_82"></a>From the odors already known we may produce, by uniting them in proper
proportion, the smell of almost any flower, except jasmine.</p><p>The odor of some flowers resembles others so nearly that we are almost
induced to believe them to be the same thing, or, at least, if not
evolved from the plant as such, to become so by the action of the
air-oxidation. It is known that some actually are identical in
composition, although produced from totally different plants, such as
camphor, turpentine, rosemary. Hence we may presume that chemistry will
sooner or later produce one from the other, for with many it is merely
an atom of water or an atom of oxygen that causes the difference. It
would be a grand thing to produce otto of roses from oil of rosemary, or
from the rose geranium oil, and theory indicates its possibility.</p><p>The essential oil of almonds in a bottle that contains a good deal of
air-oxygen, and but a very little of the oil, spontaneously passes into
another odoriferous body, benzoic acid; which is seen in crystals to
form over the dry parts of the flask. This is a natural illustration of
this idea. In giving the recipe for "sweet pea" as above, we form it
with the impression that its odor resembles the orange-blossom, which
similarity is approached nearer by the addition of the rose and
tuberose.</p><p>The vanilla is used merely to give permanence to the scent on the
handkerchief, and this latter body is chosen in preference to extract of
musk or ambergris, which would answer the same purpose of giving
permanence <a id="Page_83"></a>to the more volatile ingredients; because the vanilla
strikes the same key of the olfactory nerve as the orange-blossom, and
thus no new idea of a different scent is brought about as the perfume
dies off from the handkerchief. When perfumes are not mixed upon this
principle, then we hear that such and such a perfume becomes "sickly" or
"faint" after they have been on the handkerchief a short time.</p><p><span class="smcap">Pine-apple.</span>—Both Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Lyon Playfair have fallen
into some error in their inferences with regard to the application of
this odor in perfumery. After various practical experiments conducted in
a large perfumatory, we have come to the conclusion that it cannot be so
applied, simply because when the essence of pine-apple is smelled at,
the vapor produces an involuntary action of the larynx, producing cough,
when exceedingly dilute. Even in the infinitesimal portions it still
produces disagreeable irritation of the air-pipes, which, if prolonged,
such as is expected if used upon a handkerchief, is followed by intense
headache. It is obvious, therefore, that the legitimate use of the
essence of pine-apple (butyric ether) cannot be adapted with benefit to
the manufacturing perfumer, although invaluable to the confectioner as a
flavoring material. What we have here said refers to the artificial
essence of pine-apple, or butyrate of ethyloxide, which, if very much
diluted with alcohol, resembles the smell of pine-apple, and hence its
name; but how far the same observations are applicable to the true
essential oil from the fruit <a id="Page_84"></a>or epidermis of the pine-apple, remains to
be seen <i>when</i> we procure it. As the West Indian pine-apples are now
coming freely into the market, the day is probably not distant when
demonstrative experiments can be tried; but hitherto it must be
remembered our experiments have only been performed with a body
<i>resembling in smell</i> the true essential oil of the fruit. The physical
action of all ethers upon the human body is quite sufficient to prevent
their application in perfumery, however useful in confectionary, which
it is understood has to deal with another of the senses,—not of smell,
but of taste. The commercial "essence of pine-apple," or "pine-apple
oil," and "jargonelle pear-oil," are admitted only to be <i>labelled</i>
such, but really are certain organic acid ethers. For the present, then,
perfumers must only look on these bodies as so many lines in the "Poetry
of Science," which, for the present, are without practical application
in his art.</p><p><span class="smcap">Pink.</span>—<i>Dianthus Caryophyllus.</i>—The clove pink emits a most

adulteration of real otto of roses, but as the geranium oil answers so
much better, the oil of rhodium has fallen into disuse, hence its
comparative scarcity in the market at the present day, though our
grandfathers knew it well. One cwt. of wood yields about three ounces of
oil.</p><p>Ground rose-wood is valuable as a basis in the manufacture of sachet

</div></div><p>This queen of the garden loses not its diadem in <a id="Page_86"></a>the perfuming world.
The oil of roses, or, as it is commonly called, the otto, or attar, of
roses, is procured (contrary to so many opposite statements) simply by
distilling the roses with water.</p><p>The otto, or attar, of rose of commerce is derived from the <i>Rosa
centifolia provincialis</i>. Very extensive rose farms exist at Adrianople
(Turkey in Europe); at Broussa, now famous as the residence of
Abd-el-Kader; and at Uslak (Turkey in Asia); also at Ghazepore, in
India.</p><p>The cultivators in Turkey are principally the Christian inhabitants of
the low countries of the Balkan, between Selimno, and Carloya, as far as
Philippopolis, in Bulgaria, about 200 miles from Constantinople. In good
seasons, this district yields 75,000 ounces; but in bad seasons only
20,000 to 30,000 ounces of attar are obtained. It is estimated that it
requires at least 2000 rose blooms to yield one drachm of otto.</p><p>The otto slightly varies in odor from different districts; many places
furnish an otto which solidifies more readily than others, and,
therefore, this is not a sure guide of purity, though many consider it
such. That which was exhibited in the Crystal Palace of 1851, as "from
Ghazepore," in India, obtained the prize.</p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Attar of roses, made in Cashmere, is considered superior to any
other; a circumstance not surprising, as, according to Hugel, the
flower is here produced of surpassing fragrance as well as beauty.
A large quantity of rose-water twice distilled is allowed to run
off into an open vessel, placed over night in a cool running
stream, and in the morning the oil is found floating on the
surface in minute specks, which are taken off very <a id="Page_87"></a>carefully by
means of a blade of sword-lily. When cool it is of a dark green
color, and as hard as resin, not becoming liquid at a temperature
about that of boiling water. Between 500 and 600 pounds' weight of
leaves is required to produce one ounce of the attar."—<i>Indian
Encyclopædia.</i></p></div><p>Pure otto of roses, from its cloying sweetness, has not many admirers;
when diluted, however, there is nothing to equal it in odor, especially
if mixed in soap, to form rose soap, or in pure spirit, to form the
esprit de rose. The soap not allowing the perfume to evaporate very
fast, we cannot be surfeited with the smell of the otto.</p><p>The finest preparation of rose as an odor is made at Grasse, in France.
Here the flowers are not treated for the otto, but are subjected to the
process of maceration in fat, or in oil, as described under jasmine,
heliotrope, &amp;c.</p><p>The rose pomade thus made, if digested in alcohol, say 8 lbs. of No. 24
Pomade to one gallon of spirit, yields an esprit de rose of the first
order, very superior to that which is made by the addition of otto to
spirit. It is difficult to account for this difference, but it is
sufficiently characteristic to form a distinct odor. See the article on
fleur d'orange and neroli (pp. 77, 78), which have similar qualities,
previously described. The esprit de rose made from the French rose
pomade is never sold retail by the perfumer; he reserves this to form
part of his <i>recherche</i> bouquets.</p><p>Some wholesale druggists have, however, been selling it now for some
time to country practitioners, for them to form extemporaneous
rose-water, which <a id="Page_88"></a>it does to great perfection. Roses are cultivated to
a large extent in England, near Mitcham, in Surrey, for perfumers' use,
to make rose-water. In the season when successive crops can be got,
which is about the end of June, or the early part of July, they are
gathered as soon as the dew is off, and sent to town in sacks. When they
arrive, they are immediately spread out upon a cool floor: otherwise, if
left in a heap, they heat to such an extent, in two or three hours, as
to be quite spoiled. There is no organic matter which so rapidly absorbs
oxygen, and becomes heated spontaneously, as a mass of freshly gathered
roses.</p><p>To preserve these roses, the London perfumers immediately pickle them;
for this purpose, the leaves are separated from the stalks, and to every
bushel of flowers, equal to about six pounds' weight, one pound of
common salt is thoroughly rubbed in. The salt absorbs the water existing
in the petals, and rapidly becomes brine, reducing the whole to a pasty
mass, which is finally stowed away in casks. In this way they will keep
almost any length of time, without the fragrance being seriously
injured. A good rose-water can be prepared by distilling 12 lbs. of
pickled roses, and 2-1/2 gallons of water. "Draw" off two gallons; the
product will be the double-distilled rose-water of the shops. The
rose-water that is imported from the South of France is, however, very
superior in odor to any that can be produced here. As it is a residuary
product of the distillation of roses for procuring the attar, it has a
richness of aroma which <a id="Page_89"></a>appears to be inimitable with English-grown
roses. There are four modifications of essence of rose for the
handkerchief, which are the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of the perfumer's art. They
are,—esprit de rose triple, essence of white of roses, essence of tea
rose, and essence of moss rose. The following are the recipes for their

take its name from one of the <a id="Page_91"></a>queens of Hungary, who is reported to
have derived great benefit from a bath containing it, at the age of
seventy-five years. There is no doubt that clergymen and orators, while
speaking for any time, would derive great benefit from perfuming their
handkerchief with Hungary water or eau de Cologne, as the rosemary they
contain excites the mind to vigorous action, sufficient of the stimulant
being inhaled by occasionally wiping the face with the handkerchief
wetted with these "waters." Shakspeare giving us the key, we can

universally said to be "so refreshing!"</p><p><span class="smcap">Sage</span>.—A powerful-scenting otto can be procured by distillation

</div></div><p>This is an old favorite with the lovers of scent; it is the wood that
possesses the odor. The finest santal-wood grows in the island of Timor,
and the Santal-wood Islands, where it is extensively cultivated for the
Chinese market. In the religious ceremonies of the Brahmins, Hindoos,
and Chinese, santal-wood is burned, by way of incense, to an extent
almost beyond belief. The <i>Santala</i> grew plentifully in China, but <a id="Page_92"></a>the
continued offerings to the Buddahs have almost exterminated the plant
from the Celestial Empire; and such is the demand, that it is about to
be cultivated in Western Australia, in the expectation of a profitable
return, which we doubt not will be realized; England alone would consume
tenfold the quantity it does were its price within the range of other
perfuming substances. The otto which exists in the santal-wood is
readily procured by distillation; 1 cwt. of good wood will yield about
30 ounces of otto.</p><p><a id="santal"></a></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 346px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption10">

</div><p>The white ant, which is so common in India and China, eating into every

valuable article to the cabinet-makers of the East.</p><p>The otto of santal is remarkably dense, and is above all others

When dissolved in spirit, it enters into the composition of a great many
of the old-fashioned bouquets, such as "Marechale," and others, the

</tbody></table></div><p>All those <span class="smcap">Extracts</span>, made by dissolving the otto in alcohol, are
nearly white, or at least only slightly tinted by the color of the oil
used. When a perfumer has to impart a delicate <i>odeur</i> to a lady's
<i>mouchoir</i>, which in some instances costs "no end of money," and is an
object, at any cost, to retain unsullied, it behooves his reputation to
sell an article that will not stain a delicate white fabric. Now, when a
perfume is made in a direct manner from any wood or herb, as tinctures
are made, that is, by infusion in alcohol, there is obtained, besides
the odoriferous substance, a solution of coloring and extractive matter,
which is exceedingly detrimental to its fragrance, besides seriously
staining any cambric handkerchief that it may be used upon; and for this
reason this latter <a id="Page_94"></a>method should never be adopted, except for use upon
silk handkerchiefs.</p><p>The odor of santal assimilates well with rose; and hence, prior to the
cultivation of rose-leaf geranium, it was used to adulterate otto of
roses; but is now but seldom used for that purpose.</p><p>By a "phonetic" error, santal is often printed "sandal," and "sandel."</p><p><span class="smcap">Sassafras.</span>—Some of the perfumers of Germany use a tincture of
the wood of the <i>Laurus sassafras</i> in the manufacture of hair-washes and
other nostrums; but as, in our opinion, it has rather a "physicky" smell
than flowery, we cannot recommend the German recipes. The <i>Eau
Athenienne</i>, notwithstanding, has some reputation as a hair-water, but
is little else than a weak tincture of sassafras.</p><p><span class="smcap">Spike.</span>—French oil of lavender, which is procured from the
<i>Lavandula spica</i>, is generally called oil of spike. (See Lavender.)</p><p><span class="smcap">Storax</span> and <span class="smcap">Tolu</span> are used in perfumery in the same way
as benzoin, namely, by solution in spirit as a tincture. An ounce of
tincture of storax, tolu, or benzoin, being added to a pound of any very
volatile perfume, gives a degree of permanence to it, and makes it last
longer on the handkerchief than it otherwise would: thus, when any
perfume is made by the solution of an otto in spirit, it is usual to add
to it a small portion of a substance which is less volatile, such as
extract of musk, extract of vanilla, ambergris, storax, tolu, orris,
vitivert, or benzoin; the manufacturer using his judgment and discretion
as to which of <a id="Page_95"></a>these materials are to be employed, choosing, of course,
those which are most compatible with the odor he is making.</p><p>The power which these bodies have of "fixing" a volatile substance,
renders them valuable to the perfumer, independent of their aroma, which
is due in many cases to benzoic acid, slightly modified by an esential
oil peculiar to each substance, and which is taken up by the alcohol,
together with a portion of resin. When the perfume is put upon a
handkerchief, the most volatile bodies disappear first: thus, after the
alcohol has evaporated, the odor of the ottos appear stronger; if it
contains any resinous body, the ottos are held in solution, as it were,
by the resin, and thus retained on the fabric. Supposing a perfume to be
made of otto only, without any "fixing" substance, then, as the perfume
"dies away," the olfactory nerve, if tutored, will detect its
composition, for it spontaneously analyzes itself, no two ottos having
the same volatility: thus, make a mixture of rose, jasmine, and
patchouly; the jasmine predominates first, then the rose, and, lastly,
the patchouly, which will be found hours after the others have
disappeared.</p><p><span class="smcap">Syringa</span>.—The flowers of the <i>Philadelphus coronarius</i>, or
common garden syringa, have an intense odor resembling the
orange-blossom; so much so, that in America the plant is often termed
"mock orange." A great deal of the pomatum sold as pommade surfin, à la
fleur d'orange, by the manufacturers of Cannes, is nothing more than
fine suet perfumed <a id="Page_96"></a>with syringa blossoms by the maceration process.
Fine syringa pomade could be made in England at a quarter the cost of
what is paid for the so-called orange pomatum.</p><p><span class="smcap">Thyme.</span>—All the different species of thyme, but more
particularly the lemon thyme, the <i>Thymus serpyllum</i>, as well as the
marjorams, origanum, &amp;c., yield by distillation fragrant ottos, that are
extensively used by manufacturing perfumers for scenting soaps; though
well adapted for this purpose, they do not answer at all in any other
combinations. Both in grease and in spirit all these ottos impart an
herby smell (very naturally) rather than a flowery one, and, as a
consequence, they are not considered <i>recherché</i>.</p><p>When any of these herbs are dried and ground, they usefully enter into
the composition of sachet powders.</p><p><span class="smcap">Tonquin</span>, or <span class="smcap">Tonka</span>.—The seeds of the <i>Dipterix
odorata</i> are the tonquin or <i>coumarouma</i> beans of commerce. When fresh
they are exceedingly fragrant, having an intense odor of newly made hay.
The <i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i>, or sweet-smelling vernal grass, to which
new hay owes its odor, probably yields identically the same fragrant
principle, and it is remarkable that both tonquin beans and vernal
grass, while actually growing, are nearly scentless, but become rapidly
aromatic when severed from the parent stock.</p><p>Chemically considered, tonquin beans are very interesting, containing,
when fresh, a fragrant volatile <a id="Page_97"></a>otto (to which their odor is
principally due), benzoic acid, a fat oil and a neutral
principal—<i>Coumarin</i>. In perfumery they are valuable, as, when ground,
they form with other bodies an excellent and permanent sachet, and by
infusion in spirit, the tincture or extract of tonquin enters into a
thousand of the compound essences; but on account of its great strength
it must be used with caution, otherwise people say your perfume is
"snuffy," owing to the predominance of the odor and its well-known use
in the boxes of those who indulge in the titillating dust.</p><p><a id="tonquin"></a></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption11">

extract of orris and extract of vanilla, is never sold pure, but is only
used in the manufacture of compound perfumes. It is the leading
ingredient in <i>Bouquet du Champ</i>—The field Bouquet—the great
resemblance of which to the odor of the hay-field, renders it a favorite
to the lovers of the pastoral.</p><p><span class="smcap">Tuberose</span>.—One of the most exquisite odors with which we are
acquainted is obtained by <i>enfleurage</i> from the tuberose flower. It is,
as it were, a nosegay in itself, and reminds one of that delightful
perfume observed in a well-stocked flower-garden at evening close;
consequently it is much in demand by the perfumers for compounding sweet
essences.</p><h4><span class="smcap">Extract of Tuberose</span>.</h4><p>Eight pounds of No. 24 tuberose pomatum, cut up very fine, is to be
placed into 1 gallon of the best rectified spirit. After standing for
three weeks or a month at summer heat, and with frequent agitation, it
is fit to draw off, and being strained through cotton wool, is ready
either for sale or use in the manufacture of bouquets.</p><p>This essence of tuberose, like that of jasmine, is exceedingly volatile,
and if sold in its pure state quickly "flies off" the handkerchief; it
is therefore necessary to add some fixing ingredient, and for this
purpose it is best to use one ounce of extract of orris, or half an
ounce of extract of vanilla, to every pint of tuberose.</p><p><span class="smcap">Vanilla</span>.—The pod or bean of the <i>Vanilla planifolia</i><a id="Page_99"></a> yields a
perfume of rare excellence. When good, and if kept for some time, it
becomes covered with an efflorescence of needle crystals possessing
properties similar to benzoic acid, but differing from it in
composition. Few objects are more beautiful to look upon than this, when
viewed by a microscope with the aid of polarized light.</p><p><a id="vanilla"></a></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 483px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption12">

crushed in this act, as there is little or no odor by merely smelling at
the plant.</p><p>The otto, which can be extracted from the leaves by distillation with

</tbody></table></div><p>This mixture is exceedingly refreshing, and is one of the most elegant
perfumes that is made. Being white, it does not stain the handkerchief.
It is best when sold fresh made, as by age the citrine oils oxidize, and
the perfume acquires an ethereal odor, and then customers say "it is
sour." The vervaine thus prepared enters into the composition of a great
many of the favorite bouquets that are sold under the title "Court
Bouquet," and others which are mixtures of violet, rose, and jasmine,
with verbena or vervaine in different proportions. In these
preparations, as also in Eau de Portugal, and in fact where any of the
citrine ottos are used, a much finer product is obtained by using grape
spirit or brandy in preference to the English corn spirit as a solvent
for them. Nor do they deteriorate so quickly in French spirit as in
English. Whether this be due <a id="Page_102"></a>to the oil of wine (œanthic ether) or
not we cannot say, but think it is so.</p><p><span class="smcap">Violet</span>.—</p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The forward violet thus did I chide:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,<br></span>
<span class="i0">If not from my love's breath?"<br></span>
</div></div><p>The perfume exhaled by the <i>Viola odorata</i> is so universally admired,
that to speak in its favor would be more than superfluous. The demand
for the "essence of violets" is far greater than the manufacturing
perfumers are at present able to supply, and as a consequence, it is
difficult to procure the genuine article through the ordinary sources of
trade.</p><p>Real violet is, however, sold by many of the retail perfumers of the
West End of London, but at a price that prohibits its use except by the
affluent or extravagant votaries of fashion. The violet farms from
whence the flowers are procured to make this perfume are very extensive
at Nice and Grasse, also in the neighborhood of Florence. The true
smelling principle or otto of violets has never yet been isolated: a
very concentrated solution in alcohol impresses the olfactory nerve with
the idea of the presence of hydrocyanic acid, which is probably a true
impression. Burnett says that the plant <i>Viola tricolor</i> (heart's ease),
when bruised, smells like peach kernels, and doubtless, therefore,
contains prussic acid.</p><p>The flowers of the heart's ease are scentless, but the plant evidently
contains a principle which in other species of the Viola, is eliminated
as the<a id="Page_103"></a> "sweet that smells" so beautifully alluded to by Shakspeare.</p><p>For commercial purposes, the odor of the violet is procured in
combination with spirit, oil, or suet, precisely according to the
methods previously described for obtaining the aroma of some other
flowers before mentioned, such as those for cassie, jasmine,
orange-flower, namely, by maceration, or by <i>enfleurage</i>, the former
method being principally adopted, followed by, when "essence" is
required, digesting the pomade in rectified alcohol.</p><p>Good essence of violets, thus made, is of a beautiful green color, and,
though of a rich deep tint, has no power to stain a white fabric, and
its odor is perfectly natural.</p><p>The essence of violet, as prepared for retail sale, is thus made,
according to the quality and strength of the pomade:—Take from six to
eight pounds of the violet pomade, chop it up fine, and place it into
one gallon of perfectly clean (free from fusel oil) rectified spirit,
allow it to digest for three weeks or a month, then strain off the
essence, and to every pint thereof add three ounces of tincture of orris
root, and three ounces of esprit de cassie; it is then fit for sale.</p><p>We have often seen displayed for sale in druggists' shops plain tincture
of orris root, done up in nice bottles, with labels upon them inferring
the contents to be "Extract of Violet;" customers thus once "taken in"
are not likely to be so a second time.</p><h4>A good <span class="smcap">Imitation Essence of Violets</span> is best prepared thus—</h4><div class="center">

extract of cassie which has the leading smell, but modified by the rose
and tuberose becomes very much like the violet. Moreover, it has a green
color, like the extract of violet; and as the eye influences the
judgment by the sense of taste, so it does with the sense of smell.
Extract of violet enters largely into the composition of several of the
most popular bouquets, such as extract of spring flowers and many
others.</p><p><span class="smcap">Vitivert</span>, or Kus-Kus, is the rhizome of an Indian grass. In the
neighborhood of Calcutta, and in the city, this material has an
extensive use by being manufactured into awnings, blinds, and
sun-shades, called Tatty. During the hot seasons an attendant sprinkles
water over them; this operation cools the apartment by the evaporation
of the water, and, at the same time, perfumes the atmosphere, in a very
agreeable manner, with the odoriferous principle of the vitivert. It has
a smell between the aromatic or spicy odor and that of flowers—if such
a distinction can be admitted. We classify it with orris root, not that
it has any odor resembling it, but because it has a like effect in use
in perfumery, and because it is prepared as a tincture for obtaining its
odor.</p><p>About four pounds of the dried vitivert, as it is <a id="Page_105"></a>imported, being cut
small and set to steep in a gallon of rectified spirits for a fortnight,
produces the</p><p><span class="smcap">Essence of Vitivert</span> of the shops. In this state it is rarely
used as a perfume, although it is occasionally asked for by those who,
perhaps, have learnt to admire its odor by their previous residence in
"the Eastern clime." The extract, essence, or tincture of vitivert,
enters into the composition of several of the much-admired and old
bouquets manufactured in the early days of perfumery in England, such as
"<i>Mousselaine des Indies</i>," for which preparation M. Delcroix, in the
zenith of his fame, created quite a <i>furor</i> in the fashionable world.</p><p><a id="vitivert"></a></p><div class="figcenter" style="width: 603px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption13">

vitivert yields about 14 oz. of otto, <a id="Page_106"></a>which in appearance very much
resembles otto of santal. I have placed a sample of it in the museum at

native of India, and seems to be little known even in the botanic
gardens of this country; however, the plant has a name, and that's
enough for the versatile Parisian perfumer, and if the mixture he makes
"takes" with the fashionable world—the plant which christens it has a
fine perfume for a certainty!</p><h4><span class="smcap">Essence of Volkameria</span>.</h4><div class="center">

this flower we would direct particular attention, as one well adapted
for experiments to obtain its odoriferous principle in this country, our
climate being good for its production. The mode for obtaining its odor
has been indicated when we spoke of heliotrope, page 60. And if it
answers on the small scale, there is little doubt of success in the
large way, and there is no <a id="Page_107"></a>fear but that the scent of the old English

</tbody></table></div><p>We have now described all the important odoriferous bodies which are
used by the manufacturing perfumer, as derived from the botanic kingdom;
it may be understood that where an odoriferous material is <a id="Page_108"></a>unnoticed,
it has no qualities peculiar enough to be remarked on, and that the
methods adopted for preparing its essence, extract, water, or oil, are
analogous to those that have been already noticed, that is, by the
processes of <i>maceration</i>, <i>absorption</i>, or <i>enfleurage</i> for flowers, by
<i>tincturation</i> for roots, and by <i>distillation</i> for seeds, modified
under certain circumstances.</p><p>There are, however, three other important derivative odors—ambergris,
civet, and musk—which, being from the animal kingdom, are treated
separately from plant odors, in order, it is considered, to render the
whole matter less confused to manufacturers who may refer to them.
Ammonia and acetic acid, holding an indefinite position in the order we
have laid down, may also come in here without much criticism, being
considered as primitive odors.</p><p>On terminating our remarks relating to the simple preparations of the
odors of plants, and before we speak of perfumes of an animal origin, or
of those compound <i>odors</i> sold as bouquets, nosegays, &amp;c., it may
probably be interesting to give a few facts and statistics, showing the
