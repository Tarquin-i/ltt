Pliny informs us that soap was first discovered by\nthe Gauls, that it was composed of tallow and ashes, and that the German\nsoap was reckoned the best. According to Sismondi, the French historian,\na soapmaker was included in the retinue of Charlemagne.</p><p>At Pompeii (overwhelmed by an eruption of Vesuvius <span class=\"smcap\">a.d.</span> 79), a\nsoap-boiler's shop with soap in it was discovered during some\nexcavations made there not many years ago. (<i>Starke's Letters from\nItaly.</i>)</p><p>From these statements it is evident that the manufacture of soap is of\nvery ancient origin; indeed, Jeremiah figuratively mentions it—\"For\nthough thou wash thee with natron, and take thee much soap, yet thine\niniquity is marked before me.\" (Jer. 2:22.)</p><p>Mr. Wilson says that the earliest record of the soap trade in England is\nto be found in a pamphlet in the British Museum, printed in 1641,\nentitled \"A short Account of the Soap Business.\" It speaks more\nparticularly about the duty, which was then levied for the first time,\nand concerning certain patents which were granted to persons, chiefly\nPopish recusants, for some pretended new invention of white <a></a>soap,\n\"which in truth was not so.\" Sufficient is said here to prove that at\nthat time soap-making was no inconsiderable art.</p><p>It would be out of place here to enter into the details of soap-making,\nbecause perfumers do not manufacture that substance, but are merely\n\"remelters,\" to use a trade term. The dyer purchases his dye-stuffs from\nthe drysalters already fabricated, and these are merely modified under\nhis hands to the various purposes he requires; so with the perfumer, he\npurchases the various soaps in their raw state from the soap-makers,\nthese he mixes by remelting, scents and colors according to the article\nto be produced.</p><p>The primary soaps are divided into hard and soft soaps: the hard soaps\ncontain soda as the base; those which are soft are prepared with potash.\nThese are again divisible into varieties, according to the fatty matter\nemployed in their manufacture, also according to the proportion of\nalkali. The most important of these to the perfumer is what is termed\ncurd soap, as it forms the basis of all the highly-scented soaps.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Curd Soap</span> is a nearly neutral soap, of pure soda and fine\ntallow.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Oil Soap</span>, as made in England, is an uncolored combination of\nolive oil and soda, hard, close grain, and contains but little water in\ncombination.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Castile Soap</span>, as imported from Spain, is a similar combination,\nbut is colored by protosulphate of iron. The solution of the salt being\nadded to the soap after it is manufactured, from the presence of\n<a></a>alkali, decomposition of the salt takes place, and protoxide of iron is\ndiffused through the soap of its well-known black color, giving the\nfamiliar marbled appearance to it. When the soap is cut up into bars,\nand exposed to the air, the protoxide passes by absorption of oxygen\ninto peroxide; hence, a section of a bar of Castile soap shows the outer\nedge red-marbled, while the interior is black-marbled. Some Castile soap\nis not artificially colored, but a similar appearance is produced by the\nuse of a barilla or soda containing sulphuret of the alkaline base, and\nat other times from the presence of an iron salt.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Marine Soap</span> is a cocoanut-oil soap, of soda containing a great\nexcess of alkali, and much water combination.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Yellow Soap</span> is a soda soap, of tallow, resin, of lard, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Palm Soap</span> is a soda soap of palm oil, retaining the peculiar\nodor and color of the oil unchanged. The odoriferous principle of palm\noil resembling that from orris-root, can be dissolved out of it by\ntincturation with alcohol; like ottos generally, it remains intact in\nthe presence of an alkali, hence, soap made of palm oil retains the odor\nof the oil.</p><p>The public require a soap that will not shrink and change shape after\nthey purchase it. It must make a profuse lather during the act of\nwashing. It must not leave the skin rough after using it. It must be\neither quite inodorous or have a pleasant aroma. None of the above soaps\npossess all these qualities in union, and, therefore, to produce such an\narticle is the object of the perfumer in his remelting process.</p><p><a></a>Prior to the removal of the excise duty upon soap, in 1853, it was a\ncommercial impossibility for a perfumer to <i>manufacture</i> soap, because\nthe law did not allow less than one ton of soap to be made at a time.\nThis law, which, with certain modifications had been in force since the\nreign of Charles I, confined the actual manufacture of that article to\nthe hands of a few capitalists. Such law, however, was but of little\nimportance to the perfumer, as a soap-boiling plant and apparatus is not\nvery compatible with a laboratory of flowers; yet, in some exceptional\ninstances, these excise regulations interfered with him; such, for\ninstance, as that in making soft soap of lard and potash, known, when\nperfumed, as <i>Crême d'Amande</i>; or unscented, as a Saponaceous Cream,\nwhich has, in consequence of that law, been entirely thrown into the\nhands of our continental neighbors.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Fig Soft Soap</span> is a combination of oils, principally olive oil\nof the commonest kind, with potash.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Naples Soft Soap</span> is a fish oil (mixed with Lucca oil) and\npotash, colored brown for the London shavers, retaining, when pure, its\nunsophisticated \"fishy\" odor.</p><p>The above soaps constitute the real body or base of all the fancy\nscented soaps as made by the perfumers, which are mixed and remelted\naccording to the following formula:—</p><p>The remelting process is exceedingly simple. The bar soap is first cut\nup into thin slabs, by pressing them against a wire fixed upon the\nworking bench. This cutting wire (piano wire is the kind) is made <a></a>taut\nupon the bench, by being attached to two screws. These screws regulate\nthe height of the wire from the bench, and hence the thickness of the\nslabs from the bars. The soap is cut up into thin slabs, because it\nwould be next to impossible to melt a bar whole, on account of soap\nbeing one of the worst conductors of heat.</p><p>The melting pan is an iron vessel, of various sizes, capable of holding\nfrom 28 lbs. to 3 cwt., heated by a steam jacket, or by a water-bath.\nThe soap is put into the pan by degrees, or what is in the vernacular\ncalled \"rounds,\" that is, the thin slabs are placed perpendicularly all\nround the side of the pan; a few ounces of water are at the same time\nintroduced, the steam of which assists the melting. The pan being\ncovered up, in about half an hour the soap will have \"run down.\" Another\nround is then introduced, and so continued every half hour until the\nwhole \"melting\" is finished. The more water a soap contains, the easier\nis it melted; hence a round of marine soap, or of new yellow soap, will\nrun down in half the time that it requires for old soap.</p><p>When different soaps are being remelted to form one kind when finished,\nthe various sorts are to be inserted into the pan in alternate rounds,\nbut each round must consist only of one kind, to insure uniformity of\ncondition. As the soap melts, in order to mix it, and to break up lumps,\n&amp;c., it is from time to time \"<i>crutched</i>.\" The \"crutch\" is an instrument\nor tool for stirring up the soap; its name is indicative of its form, a\nlong handle with a short cross—an <a></a>inverted 'T',\ncurved to fit the curve of the pan. When the soaps are all melted,\nit is then colored, if so required, and then the perfume is added, the\nwhole being thoroughly incorporated with the crutch.</p><p><a id=\"gauge\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 472px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption19\">\n<img alt=\"Frame and Slab Gauge.\" height=\"325\" src=\"/static/images/book/image1-176.png\" title=\"\" width=\"472\" id=\"img_images_image1-176.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption19\">Frame and Slab Gauge.</span>\n</div><p>The soap is then turned into the \"frame.\" The frame is a box made in\nsections, in order that it can be taken to pieces, so that the soap can\nbe cut up when cold; the sections or \"lifts\" are frequently made of the\nwidth of the intended bar of soap.</p><p><a id=\"barring\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 414px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption20\">\n<img alt=\"Barring Gauge.\" height=\"215\" src=\"/static/images/book/image2-176.png\" title=\"\" width=\"414\" id=\"img_images_image2-176.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption20\">Barring Gauge.</span>\n</div><p>Two or three days after the soap has been in the frame, it is cool\nenough to cut into slabs of the size of the lifts or sections of the\nframe; these slabs are set up edgeways to cool for a day or two more; it\nis <a></a>then barred by means of a wire. The lifts of the frame regulate the\nwidths of the bars; the gauge regulates their breadth. The density of\nthe soap being pretty well known, the gauges are made so that the\nsoap-cutter can cut up the bars either into fours, sixes, or eights;\nthat is, either into squares of four, six, or eight to the pound weight.\nLatterly, various mechanical arrangements have been introduced for\nsoap-cutting, which in very large establishments, such as those at\nMarseilles in France, are great economisers of labor; but in England the\n\"wire\" is still used.</p><p><a id=\"squaring\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 509px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption21\">\n<img alt=\"Squaring Gauge.\" height=\"259\" src=\"/static/images/book/image1-177.png\" title=\"\" width=\"509\" id=\"img_images_image1-177.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption21\">Squaring Gauge.</span>\n</div><p><a id=\"scoop\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 490px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption22\">\n<img alt=\"Soap Scoop.\" height=\"298\" src=\"/static/images/book/image2-177.png\" title=\"\" width=\"490\" id=\"img_images_image2-177.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption22\">Soap Scoop.</span>\n</div><p>For making tablet shapes the soap is first cut into <a></a>squares, and is\nthen put into a mould, and finally under a press—a modification of an\nordinary die or coin press.

The high temperature of the soap under\nthese circumstances involves the obvious loss of a great deal of perfume\nby evaporation. With very highly scented soaps, and with perfume of an\nexpensive character, the loss of ottos is too great to be borne in a\ncommercial sense; hence the adoption of the plan of</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\">Scenting Soaps cold</span>.</h4><p>This method is exceedingly convenient and economical for scenting small\nbatches, involving merely mechanical labor, the tools required being\nsimply an ordinary carpenter's plane, and a good marble mortar, and\nlignum vitæ pestle.</p><p>The woodwork of the plane must be fashioned at each end, so that when\nplaced over the mortar it remains firm and not easily moved by the\nparallel pressure of the soap against its projecting blade.</p><p>To commence operations, we take first 7 lbs., 14 lbs., or 21 lbs. of the\nbars of the soap that it is intended <a></a>to perfume.

Like the French\n\"Charbonnier,\" who does not saw the wood, but woods the saw, so it will\nbe perceived that in this process we do not plane the soap, but that we\nsoap the plane, the shavings of which fall lightly into the mortar as\nquickly as produced.</p><p><a id=\"plane\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 429px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption25\">\n<img alt=\"Soaping the Plane.\" height=\"306\" src=\"/static/images/book/image183.png\" title=\"\" width=\"429\" id=\"img_images_image183.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption25\">Soaping the Plane.</span>\n</div><p>Soap, as generally received from the maker, is the proper condition for\nthus working; but if it has been in stock any time it becomes too hard,\nand must have from one to three ounces of distilled water sprinkled in\nthe shaving for every pound of soap employed, and must lay for at least\ntwenty-four hours to be absorbed before the perfume is added.</p><p>When it is determined what size the cakes of soap are to be, what they\nare to sell for, and what it is intended they should cost, then the\nmaker can measure out his perfume.</p><p><a></a>In a general way, soaps scented in this way retail from 4<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>\nper pound, bearing about 100 per cent. profit, which is not too much\nconsidering their limited sale.

After a couple of hours of \"warm exercise,\" the soap is\ngenerally expected to be free from streaks, and to be of one uniform\nconsistency.</p><p>For perfuming soap in large portions by the cold process, instead of\nusing the pestle and mortar as an incorporator, it is more convenient\nand economical to employ a mill similar in construction to a cake\nchocolate-mill, or a flake cocoa-mill; any mechanical apparatus that\nanswers for mixing paste and crushing lumps will serve pretty well for\nblending soap together.</p><p>Before going into the mill, the soap is to be reduced to shavings, and\nhave the scent and color stirred in; after leaving it, the flakes or\nribands of soap are to be finally bound together by the pestle and\nmortar into one solid mass; it is then weighed out in quantities for the\ntablets required, and moulded by the hand into egg-shaped masses; each\npiece being left in this condition, separately laid in rows on a sheet\nof white paper, dries sufficiently in a day or so to be fit for the\npress, which is the same as that previously mentioned. It is usual,\nbefore placing the cakes of soap in the press, to dust them over with a\nlittle starch-powder, or else to very slightly oil the mould; <a></a>either of\nthese plans prevents the soap from adhering to the letters or embossed\nwork of the mould—a condition essential for turning out a clean\nwell-struck tablet.</p><p>The body of all the fine soaps mentioned below should consist of the\nfinest and whitest curd soap, or of a soap previously melted and colored\nto the required shade, thus:—</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Rose-colored Soap</span> is curd soap stained with vermilion, ground\nin water, thoroughly incorporated when the soap is melted, and not very\nhot.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Green Soap</span> is a mixture of palm oil soap and curd soap, to\nwhich is added powdered smalt ground with water.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Blue Soap</span>, curd soap colored with smalt.</p><p><span class=\"smcap\">Brown Soap</span>, curd soap with caramel, <i>i.e.</i> burnt sugar.</p><p>The intensity of color varies, of course, with the quantity of coloring.</p><p>Some kinds of soap become colored or tinted to a sufficient extent by\nthe mere addition of the ottos used for scenting, such as \"spermaceti\nsoap,\" \"lemon soap,\" &amp;c., which become of a beautiful pale lemon color\nby the mere mixing of the perfume with the curd soap.</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\">Otto of Rose Soap</span>.</h4><h4>(<i>To retail at 10s. per pound</i>.)</h4><div class=\"center\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Curd soap (previously colored with vermilion),</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">4-1/2 lbs.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Otto of rose,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1 oz.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Spirituous extract of musk,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">2 oz.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">Otto of santal,</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\">1/4 oz.</td></tr>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This yields a moderately firm and clear soap,\nwhich may be readily used by application to parts affected with\neruptions at night, mixed with a little water, and carefully washed off\nthe following morning. This soap has lately been much used for eruptive\ndisorders, particularly on the Continent, and with varying degrees of\nsuccess. It is thought that the efficient element in its composition is\na rather less impure hydrocarburet than that known in Paris under the\nname <i>huile de cade</i>. On account of its ready miscibility with water, it\npossesses great advantage over the common tar ointment.</p><h4><span class=\"smcap\"><a></a>Medicated Soaps</span>.</h4><p>Six years ago I began making a series of medicated soaps, such as\n<span class=\"smcap\">Sulphur Soap, Iodine Soap, Bromine Soap, Creosote Soap, Mercurial\nSoap, Croton Oil Soap</span>, and many others. These soaps are prepared by\nadding the medicant to curd soap, and then making in a tablet form for\nuse. For sulphur soap, the curd soap may be melted, and flowers of\nsulphur added while the soap is in a soft condition. For antimony soap\nand mercurial soap, the low oxides of the metals employed may also be\nmixed in the curd soap in a melted state. Iodine, bromine, creosote\nsoap, and others containing very volatile substances, are best prepared\ncold by shaving up the curd soap in a mortar, and mixing the medicant\nwith it by long beating.</p><p>In certain cutaneous diseases the author has reason to believe that they\nwill prove of infinite service as auxiliaries to the general treatment.\nIt is obvious that the absorbent vessels of the skin are very active\nduring the lavoratory process; such soap must not, therefore, be used\nexcept by the special advice of a medical man. Probably these soaps will\nbe found useful for internal application. The precedent of the use of\nCastile soap (containing oxide of iron) renders it likely that when\nprejudice has passed away, such soaps will find a place in the\npharmacopœias. The discovery of the solubility, under certain\nconditions, of the active alkaloids, quinine, morphia, &amp;c., in oil, by\nMr. W. Bastick, greatly favors the supposition of analogous compounds in\nsoap.</p><hr style=\"width: 65%;\">"
