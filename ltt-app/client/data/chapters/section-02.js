The art of\nperfumery does not, however, confine itself to the production of scents\nfor the handkerchief and bath, but extends to imparting odor to\ninodorous bodies, such as soap, oil, starch, and grease, which are\nconsumed at the toilette of fashion. Some idea of the commercial\nimportance of this art may be formed, when we state that one of the\nlarge perfumers of Grasse and Paris employs annually 80,000 lbs. of\norange flowers, 60,000 lbs. of cassia flowers, 54,000 lbs. of\nrose-leaves, 32,000 lbs. of jasmine blossoms, 32,000 lbs. of violets,\n20,000 lbs. of tubereuse, 16,000 lbs. of lilac, besides rosemary, mint,\nlemon, citron, thyme, and other odorous plants in <a></a>large proportion. In\nfact, the quantity of odoriferous substances used in this way is far\nbeyond the conception of those even used to abstract statistics.</p><p>To the chemical philosopher, the study of perfumery opens a book as yet\nunread; for the practical perfumer, on his laboratory shelves, exhibits\nmany rare essential oils, such as essential oil of the flower of the\n<i>Acacia farnesiana</i>, essential oil of violets, tubereuse, jasmine, and\nothers, the compositions of which have yet to be determined.</p><p>The exquisite pleasure derived from smelling fragrant flowers would\nalmost instinctively induce man to attempt to separate the odoriferous\nprinciple from them, so as to have the perfume when the season denies\nthe flowers. Thus we find the alchemists of old, torturing the plants in\nevery way their invention could devise for this end; and it is on their\nexperiments that the whole art of perfumery has been reared. Without\nrecapitulating those facts which may be found diffused through nearly\nall the old authors on medical botany, chemistry, pharmacy, and works of\nthis character, from the time of Paracelsus to Celnart, we may state at\nonce the mode of operation adopted by the practical perfumer of the\npresent day for preparing the various extracts or essences, waters,\noils, pomades, &amp;c., used in his calling.</p><p>The processes are divided into four distinct operations; viz.—</p><p><a></a>1. <i>Expression</i>; 2. <i>Distillation</i>; 3. <i>Maceration</i>; 4. <i>Absorption</i>.</p><p>1. <i>Expression</i> is only adopted where the plant is very prolific in its\nvolatile or essential oil,—<i>i.e.</i> its odor; such, for instance, as is\nfound in the pellicle or outer peel of the orange, lemon, and citron,\nand a few others. In these cases, the parts of the plant containing the\nodoriferous principle are put sometimes in a cloth bag, and at others by\nthemselves into a press, and by mere mechanical force it is squeezed\nout. The press is an iron vessel of immense strength, varying in size\nfrom six inches in diameter, and twelve deep, and upwards, to contain\none hundred weight or more; it has a small aperture at the bottom to\nallow the expressed material to run for collection; in the interior is\nplaced a perforated false bottom, and on this the substance to be\nsqueezed is placed, covered with an iron plate fitting the interior;\nthis is connected with a powerful screw, which, being turned, forces the\nsubstance so closely together, that the little vessels containing the\nessential oils are burst, and it thus escapes. The common tincture press\nis indeed a model of such an instrument. The oils which are thus\ncollected are contaminated with watery extracts, which exudes at the\nsame time, and from which it has to be separated; this it does by itself\nin a measure, by standing in a quiet place, and it is then poured off\nand strained.</p><p><a id=\"pipette\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 319px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption1\">\n<img alt=\"Pipette to draw off small portions of otto from water.\" height=\"319\" src=\"/static/images/book/image032.png\" title=\"\" width=\"319\" id=\"img_images_image032.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption1\">Pipette to draw off small portions of otto from water.</span>\n</div><p>2. <i>Distillation.</i>—The plant, or part of it, which <a></a>contains the\nodoriferous principle, is placed in an iron, copper, or glass pan,\nvarying in size from that capable of holding from one to twenty gallons,\nand covered with water; to the pan a dome-shaped lid is fitted,\nterminating with a pipe, which is twisted corkscrew fashion, and fixed\nin a bucket, with the end peeping out like a tap in a barrel. The water\nin the still—for such is the name of the apparatus—is made to boil;\nand having no other exit, the steam must pass through the coiled pipe;\nwhich, being surrounded with cold water in the bucket, condenses the\nvapor before it can arrive at the tap. With the steam, the volatile\noils—<i>i.e.</i> perfume—rises, and is liquefied at the same time. The\nliquids which thus run over, on standing for a time, separate into two\nportions, and are finally divided with a funnel having a stopcock in the\nnarrow part of it. By this process, <a></a>the majority of the volatile or\nessential oils are procured. In some few instances alcohol—<i>i.e.</i>\nrectified spirit of wine—is placed upon the odorous materials in lieu\nof water, which, on being distilled, comes away with the perfuming\nsubstance dissolved in it. But this process is now nearly obsolete, as\nit is found more beneficial to draw the oil or essence first with water,\nand afterwards to dissolve it in the spirit. The low temperature at\nwhich spirit boils, compared with water, causes a great loss of\nessential oil, the heat not being sufficient to disengage it from the\nplant, especially where seeds such as cloves or caraway are employed. It\nso happens, however, that the finest odors, the <i>recherché</i> as the\nParisians say, cannot be procured by this method; then recourse is had\nto the next process.</p><p><a id=\"funnel\"></a></p><div class=\"figcenter\" style=\"width: 347px;\" role=\"figure\" aria-labelledby=\"ebm_caption2\">\n<img alt=\"Tap funnel for separating ottos from water and spirits from oil.\" height=\"345\" src=\"/static/images/book/image033.png\" title=\"\" width=\"347\" id=\"img_images_image033.png\">\n<span class=\"caption\" id=\"ebm_caption2\">Tap funnel for separating ottos from water and spirits\nfrom oil.</span>\n</div><p>3. <i>Maceration.</i>—Of all the processes for procuring the perfumes of\nflowers, this is the most important to the perfumer, and is the least\nunderstood in England; as this operation yields not only the most\nexquisite <a></a>essences indirectly, but also nearly all those fine pomades\nknown here as \"French pomatums,\" so much admired for the strength of\nfragrance, together with \"French oils\" equally perfumed. The operation\nis conducted thus:—For what is called pomade, a certain quantity of\npurified mutton or deer suet is put into a clean metal or porcelain pan,\nthis being melted by a steam heat; the kind of flowers required for the\nodor wanted are carefully picked and put into the liquid fat, and\nallowed to remain from twelve to forty-eight hours; the fat has a\nparticular affinity or attraction for the oil of flowers, and thus, as\nit were, draws it out of them, and becomes itself, by their aid, highly\nperfumed; the fat is strained from the spent flowers, and fresh are\nadded four or five times over, till the pomade is of the required\nstrength; these various strengths of pomatums are noted by the French\nmakers as Nos. 6, 12, 18, and 24, the higher numerals indicating the\namount of fragrance in them. For perfumed oils the same operation is\nfollowed; but, in lieu of suet, fine olive oil or oil of ben, derived\nfrom the ben nuts of the Levant, is used, and the same results are\nobtained. These oils are called \"Huile Antique\" of such and such a\nflower.</p><p>When neither of the foregoing processes gives satisfactory results, the\nmethod of procedure adopted is by,—</p><p>4. <i>Absorption</i>, or <i>Enfleurage.</i>—The odors of some flowers are so\ndelicate and volatile, that the heat required in the previously named\nprocesses would <a></a>greatly modify, if not entirely spoil them; this\nprocess is, therefore, conducted cold, thus:—Square frames, about three\ninches deep, with a glass bottom, say two feet wide and three feet long,\nare procured; over the glass a layer of fat is spread, about half an\ninch thick, with a kind of plaster knife or spatula; into this the\nflower buds are stuck, cup downwards, and ranged completely over it, and\nthere left from twelve to seventy-two hours.</p><p>Some houses, such as that of Messrs. Pilar and Sons; Pascal Brothers; H.\nHerman, and a few others, have 3000 such frames at work during the\nseason; as they are filled, they are piled one over the other, the\nflowers are changed so long as the plants continue to bloom, which now\nand then exceeds two or three months.</p><p>For oils of the same plants, coarse linen cloths are imbued with the\nfinest olive oil or oil of ben, and stretched upon a frame made of iron;\non these the flowers are laid and suffered to remain a few days. This\noperation is repeated several times, after which the cloths are\nsubjected to great pressure, to remove the now perfumed oil.</p><p>As we cannot give any general rule for working, without misleading the\nreader, we prefer explaining the process required for each when we come\nto speak of the individual flower or plant.</p><hr style=\"width: 65%;\">"
